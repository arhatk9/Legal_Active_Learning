 One Indra Narayan Biswas executed a deed called "Declaration of Trust Deed" on April 9, 1904 dedicating 26 items of his immovable property, mostly houses and buildings situated in Calcutta and other places, to the family deity Sree Sree Iswar Lakshmi Janardan. As per term 8, after his death Sarvashree Abinash Chandra Bhowmick and Jogendra Nath Biswas were to be the joint Shebaits and trustees with equal rights. On the same day, ie. 9-4-1904 Indra Narayan Biswas executed a will, bequeathing, his movable and immovable pro- perties to his relations. In this will, he further provided that in case the deed of Declaration of Trust fails, Abinash Chandra Bhowmick, his sister's son, would get the properties included in the said deed.
 Indra Naravan Biswas died on 7-8-1905. Jogendra Nath Biswas predeceased him. Indra Narayan was survived by his sister's son,, Abinash Chandra Bhowmick, and Bipin Bihari Biswas 'and Girindra Biswas, both brothers of Jogendra Nath and sons of another brother of Indra Narayan. After the death of Indra Narayan, Girindra, Bipin and Abinash executed on February 2, 1906 an Ekrarnama [deed of agreement Ex. 3] whereby it was agreed inter alia, that the three executants and their respective heirs would be in equal rights shebaits and trustees of the debuttar estate and each would receive Rs.
 900/per annum from the debuttar estate. By a subsequent deed, dated 24-3-1916 (Ex. 2) all the three agreed among themselves that Abinash Chandra Bhowmick and his heirs would have an exclusive right to manage the affairs of the deity and the debuttar estate and neither Bipin, nor Girindra, nor their respective legal heirs would be entitled to interfere in any manner, but would continue to receive the annuity of Rs. 900/- each. The remuneration for Abinash and his heirs were increased to Rs. 1200/- per month. Compensation to the tune of rupees five lakhs and odd, was deposited by the President Calcutta Improvement Tribunal in C.D. case No. 54 of 1922 by the Calcutta Improvement Trust which acquired some of the debuttar properties. Girindra died in 1917 survived by his sons and heirs Pulin Behari and Palton Behari. Abinash Chandra Bhowmick died on April 2, 1936 survived by his sons (respondents 1 to 5 herein and Nandlal Bhowmick original defendant No. 2 since deceased). Bipin Bihari died in December 1941 survived by his son Panchanian Biswas plaintiff-appellant No. 2.
 After the death of Abinash, on 8-10-1947 two of his sons Pannalal and Nihar Ranjan Bhowmick instituted a Title Suit 55/47 against their other brothers Nagendra. Nandlal.
 Panchulal and Benoy Kumar Bhowmick for a declaration of the nature, character and amount of lights of the parties in the suit property and for framing a scheme for management of debuttar,but The deity Sree Sree Lakshmi Narain Janardan Jiew was also impleaded through guardian ad litem Sri Ishwar Vidyalankar The Trial Court, on an interpretation of the terms of the Trust, held that it did not create an absolute debuttar, but only charged the properties with the expenditure of the worship of the deities and the idol mentioned in the trust deed. The Trial Court did not accept the scheme of arrangement filed by the parties, and directed further that the compensation lying in deposit in C.D. case No. 54/1922 shall be utilised "for erection 856 of a temple and, Thakurbari" as desired by the founder and the "surplus income of the property shall, be utilised in purchasing Government promissory notes, but the interest whereof shall be given over to the descendants of Abinash, according to shares". Against that decree, dated 21-4-1949 the plaintiffs Pannalal and Nihar Ranjan in their capacity as shebaits of the deity preferred an appeal to the Calcutta High Court. On 28-6-1950, on an application seeking permission to compromise the claim on behalf of the guardian ad item of the deity and the appellant plaintiffs, before it the Division bench granted the permission as it appeared to be for the benefit of the deity and a decree was passed in terms of the compromise and the appeal dispose of accordingly.
 On 6-4-1953, the appellant herein being a member of the Guru family of the founder, Indra Narayan Biswas instituted Tide Suit No. 31 of 1953 against the respondents, for preservation of the debuttar properties from waste and mis- appropriation, in exercise. of the right claimed under Term No. 1 8 of the Trust deed, and for a declaration that the properties mentioned in schedules 'A' and 'B' of the plaint are the absolute, debutar properties of the deity and the respondents were not entitled to withdraw the money or enter into a compromise and that 'solenama' or compromise was null and void being collusive. 'The respondents denied the allegations and pleaded that a suit for bare declaration was hit by Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. The appellant's locus stand to maintain the suit was also questioned. The Trial Court decreed the suit, which was affirmed in appeal by the District Judge. But the High Court allowed the second appeal of the respondents and dismissed the suit. The High Court upheld the findings of the Court below with regard to the maintainability of the suit and the suit property being a debuttar property. While purporting to proceed on the, basis that Bhowmicks obtained the consent decree collusively held that the decree did not become null and void and was require to be avoided in proper proceedings. In this connection it propounded the proposi- tion that a collusive and fraudulent decree passed by a Court in invitum is "not a decree at all" and does not need setting aside, but a compromise decree being an agreement between the parties to which the sanction of the Court is super-added, stands on a different footing and "even if the sanction obtained by fraud is not sanction in law the agreement between the parties stands and that contract requires to be set aside", that the plaintiff could have sued for setting aside the compromise decree on the ground of fraud, but he did not, and consequently, he- could not treat an earlier judgment even if obtained by fraud and collusion as null and void. The High Court further held :
 "In the present suit, the Biswases are not represented as Shebaits of the deity and therefore, cannot represent the interest of the deity and they have no personal interest in the matter. So far as the plaintiff Jadugopal is concerned, he has filed the suit for the interest of the deity and he cannot raise pleas which the deity could not, because he really represented the interest of the deity. Therefore, we must hold that the compromise decree is binding upon the deity and unless set aside, it operates as estoppel." A prayer for the amendment of the plaint on behalf of the deity, who had been re-transposed as co-plaintiff, for setting aside the decree was declined. In the result, the appeal was allowed with costs, and the suit was dismissed.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court 
HELD : 1. When the property dedicated is very large and the religious ceremonies which are apparently prescribed by the Settlor cannot exhaust the entire income, some portion of the beneficial interest may be construed as undisposed of and cannot 'out vest as secular property in the heirs of the settlor, where, although the document purports on the face of it to be an out and out dedication of entire property to the deity, yet a scrutiny of the actual provisions reveals the fact that the donor did not intend to give the entire interest to the deity, but reserved some portions of the property or its profits for the benefit of his family relations. In all such cases, the debuttar is partial and incomplete, and the dedicated property does not vest in the deity as a judicial person. It remains with the grantee or secular heirs of the settlor, subject to a trust or charge for the religious uses. [872 D-F] Sri Sri Iswari Bhubaneshwari Thakurani v. Brojo Nath Dey and Ors.. 64 Indian Appeals 203 referred to.

2. There is no statutory, rule according to which, it was obligatory for the Court to issue notices to all persons which could possibly have an interest in the subject matter of litigation, before granting leave to the- guardian of the deity to compromise the case. [875 C-D] 
3. In the instant case (a)The plea of collusion and fraud set up by the plaintiff appellants is said to be founded on two primary circumstances : (i) that the suit property was absolute debuttar and (ii) that no notice or opportunity was given to Panchanan, who had an interest in Shebaitship. The existence or non-existence of both these primary facts depends on a construction of the basic documents : Deed of Trust (Ex. 1) Deeds Ex. 3 and Ex. 2. Construction of these basic documents which go to the root of the matter, is a question of law and could be gone into in Second Appeal.
 [871 A-C] (b)The deed of trust (Ex. 1) prescribes no destination of the growing income which will become surplus after meeting the expenses prescribed by the Settlor for the worship of the deities, the performance of the specified religious festivals and the building of the Thakurbari temple. [873 E- F] (c) The Deed of Trust (Ex. 1) was capable of two possible constructions (i) It created only a partial dedication and not an absolute debuttar, the properties being charged for seva puja or other religious purposes to the extent specified therein and (ii) It created an absolute debuttar in favour of the deity, The former construction was expressly adopted in the previous suit (Title Suit 55/47) by the Trial Court and presumably by the High Court in F.A.
 257/49 while granting leave to the guardian ad litem of the deity to compromise the case on terms embodied in the compromise decree. [873 F-G] In the present round of litigation, the Courts below have adopted the latter construction. The view taken by the Courts in the previous litigation as to the nature of the dedication was not beyond the orbit of reasonable possibility. Thus the existence of the first primary circumstance, viz.-that the suit properties belonged to the deity as absolute debuttar-from which an inference of collusion and fraud was sought to be drawn-had not been clearly and indubitably established. [873 G-H. 874 A] (d)Panchanan Biswas was not a necessary party to be implement in the previous suit or F.A. 257/49. His right to receive the fixed quit-annuity as per the second Ekrarnama (Ex. 2) dated 24-3-46, was in no way affected by the Compromise decree. On the contrary, it had been expressly safeguarded. The name of Iswar Chandra Vidyalankar or his successor as guardian ad litem of the deity, though put forth by the plaintiffs in that litigation was accepted by the Court. [875 C-D] (e)The failure of the Bhowmicks to impleaded Panchanan Biswas in the previous suit or in F.A. 257/49 or of the guardian ad litem to give him notice of the application for leave to compromise the case was not a circumstance of a definite tendency which could inevitably lead to an inference of fraud being practiced on the Court. The High Court was, therefore, entitled in exercise of its powers under section 103 of the Code of Civil Procedure to go into that question and there was no evidence to show that the compromise decree in question was obtained by fraud. [875 D- F] (f)The compromise was not destructive of the endowment or the object of the dedication. The terms of the compromise were prima facie not unreasonable. By no stretch of imagination, it could be said that no prudent Court would have granted leave to the guardian of the deity to compromise the case on these terms. The High Court is presumed to have perused the record including the Trust deed, and considered the terms of the compromise before sanctioning, it and allowing a decree in terms thereof. [876 A-B]
