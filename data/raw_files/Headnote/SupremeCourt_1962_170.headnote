 The appellants were convicted of murder. The substantial evidence on which the conviction rested was the evidence of an approver and the confessions of two coaccused.
 Held, that the conviction of the appellants could not be sustained. Though there is no bar for a conviction being based upon the evidence of an approver alone, as a matter of prudence the courts always require that such evidence should be corroborated in material particulars. The need for corroboration is all the greater in a case like the present where the approver, apart,from being of bad character, could not be said to be a man of truth since he had resiled from his confession before the Committing Court. The retracted confessions of the co-accused in the present case could not be safely relied upon for corroborating the approver. The confession of an accomplice which cannot be tested by cross- examination is a very weak type of evidence. Even if some weight could be attached to confessions when made by two or more accomplices independently of each other implicating a particular accused the confessions in the present case were not such as could be taken as good corroboration of the approver.
