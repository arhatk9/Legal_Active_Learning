 Section 5(1) of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 provides for the fixation and revision of minimum wages in the scheduled industries by the appropriate Government. Under s. 5(1)(a) such fixation or revision is to be made after enquiry by a committee or committees appointed for the purpose. Under s, 5(1)(b) the appropriate Government may by notification publish its proposals in this regard and take its decision after considering the representations of those affected. if the Government adopts the latter method for revision of wages, it has also before doing so to consult the Advisory Board constituted under the Act. The State Government of Mysore after following the method prescribed in s. 5(1) (b) and after consulting the Advisory Board constituted under s., 7 of the Act by notification in S.O. 1038 dated 1st June, 1967 fixed the minimum wages for different classes of employees in residential hostels and eating houses in the State of Mysore. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court questioning the validity of the notification and failing there, appealed to this Court. The notification was also challenged by a writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution. It was urged on behalf of the appellant and petitioners that the power given to the Government to choose between the methods provided in ss. 5(1) (a) and 5(1)(b) was arbitrary and unguided; that the arbitrary power given to the Central and State Governments to fix minimum wages was violative of freedom of trade guaranteed in Art. 19(1)(f) of the Constitution; that the State Government had not observed the principles of natural justice in exercising its quasi- judicial power of fixing minimum wages; and that it was incumbent on Government to appoint a committee under S.
 5(1)(a). The fixation of different rates of wages for different industries and zones in the State was also attacked. It was finally submitted that the valuation of the food supplied to the workmen was without authority of law and at an unreasonably low figure.
 
HELD : Procedural inequality if real and substantial is within. the vice of Art 14. But if a power is given to an authority to have recourse to different procedures under different circumstances, that power cannot be considered an arbitrary power. The power under s. 5(1) is given to the State Government and not to any petty official. The State Government can be, trusted to exercise that power to further the purposes of the Act. [608 H-609 B] Art. 43 of the Constitution as well 'as the Geneva Convention of 1928 enjoin the State to secure to all workers conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social 601 and cultural opportunities. The fixing of the minimum wages is !lust the first step in that direction. The concept of minimum wage is likelY to undergo a change with the growth of our economy and with the change in the standard of living. It is not a static concept Its concomitants must necessarily increase with the progress of the Society. It is absolutely impossible for the legislature to undertake the task of fixing minimum wages in respect of an industry much less in respect of an employment. That process must necessarily be left to the Government. [609 G-H; 610 A] In respect of s. 5(1) the legislative policy has been laid down with sufficient clearness. The Government is merely charged with the duty of implementing that policy. Whether under s. 5(1)(a) or under s. 5(1)(b) the procedure is only for gathering the necessary information. The Government is not bound by the advice of the committee appointed under s.
 5(1)(a). Discretion to select one of the two procedures prescribed for collecting the data is advisedly left to the Government. The powers conferred on the Government cannot be considered as either unguided or arbitrary. In the present case the Government had before it the question of fixing minimum wages for residential hotels and eating houses since 1960 and therefore, it was reasonable to assume that it had adequate material on the basis of which it could formulate its proposals. Before publishing its proposals, the Government bad consulted the advisory committee constituted under s. 7. Under those circumstances it could not be held that either the power conferred under s. 5(1) was an arbitrary power or that the same had been arbitrarily exercised. [610 B-G] (ii) There was nothing to show that the minimum wages fixed were basically wrong so as to adversely affect the industry or even a small unit therein. If they do, then the industry or the unit as the case may be has no right to exist.
 Freedom of trade does not mean freedom to exploit. The provisions of the Constitution are not erected as barriers' to progress. It is a fallacy to think that in our Constitution there are only rights and no duties There is no conflict between Part III and Part IV of the Constitution which are complementary and supplemental to each other. The hopes and aspirations aroused by the Constitution will be the minimum needs of the lowest of our citizens are not met.
 based on Art. 19(1) (f) raised in the present case could not therefore succeed. [612 B-E] (iii) The principles of natural justice are not embodied rules. What particular rules of natural justice, if any, should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that the framework of the law under which the enquiry is held and the constitution of the tribunal or body of persons appointed for the purpose.
 Taking into consideration the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, the objective behind it, the purposes intended to be achieved and the high authority on which power had been conferred there could be no doubt that the procedure adopted was adequate and effective. There was equally no doubt that reasonable opportunity had been given to all the concerned parties to represent their case. It could not be accepted that the impugned order was vitiated because of the Government's failure to constitute a committee under s. 5(1) (a). [612 H-613 C] There was also no substance in the contention that the Government was not competent to enhance the rate mentioned in the proposals published. If it had power to reduce those rates 'as desired by the employers, it necessarily followed that it had power to enhance them, There was no merit in the contention that the Government must go on publishing pro- posals after proposals until a stage is reached where no change whatsoever is necessary to be made in the last proposal made. [613 C] 602 (iv) The contention that the Government has no power to fix different minimum wages for different industries or in different localities is no more available in view of this Court's decisions in M/s Bhaikusa Yamasa Kahatriya's case.
 The fixation of minimum wages depends on the prevailing economic conditions, the cost of living in a place, the nature of the work to be performed and the conditions in which the work is performed. The contention that it was impermissible for the Government to divide the State into several zones was opposed to s. 3(3) as well as to the scheme of the Act. [613 E] On the basis of the material on record it could not be said that the various zones had no rational basis. In considering the Zones the relevant consideration is the cost of living in a locality and not the cost of living index.[613 F] (v) On the facts of the case the contention relating to the value of the food that may be supplied to an employee was not merely petty but misconcived. The supply of meals to workers, was only an option given and not a duty imposed on the employer. Therefore the procedure prescribed in r. 21 of the rules framed under the Act was inapplicable to the case. The supply of food was an amenity and the rule applicable was therefore r. 22(2)(v).
 [Question whether fixation of minimum wages is a quasi- judicial act left open].
