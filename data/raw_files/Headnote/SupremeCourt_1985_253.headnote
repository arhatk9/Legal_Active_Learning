 Acquisition proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in respect of the lands in possession of the respondents Nos. 2 and 3 were started and an award made.
 Respondents Nos. 2 and 3 filed a civil suit for declaration that the acquisition proceedings and the award pursuant thereto were illegal and for an injunction restraining defendants from taking possession. It was contended that no notice was given to them under s.4 and 9(3) of the Act, that they were not aware of the land acquisition proceedings until their landlord told them that possession was to be handed over to the Government, that they were the tenants and had raised structures at their own costs and, therefore, in absence of individual notice to them the entire proceedings are vitiated. The appellant-State contested the suit alleging that the notification under s.4 was published in the Gazette, and that apart, this notification as well as notices under ss. 9 and 10 were also pasted on the site to be acquired and were also served on the persons known or believed to be interested in the land.
 The Trial Judge dismissed the suit holding that since the respondents had actual knowledge of the intended acquisition, failure to give individual notice under s.9(3) does not invalidate the acquisition proceedings. This order was confirmed by the First Appellate Court. In the Second Appeal by respondents, the High Court set aside the acquisition proceedings relying on its earlier decision in Ashok kumar Gordhanbhai v. State of Gujarat & Ors. and holding that under s.4 of the Act read with Rule 1 of the rules framed by the State Government under s.55 of the Act, service of notice on parties interested in the land is not only obligatory but a condition precedent and, therefore, the acquisition proceedings were bad and granted injunction as prayed for.
 873 In appeal to this Court by the State it was contended that the respondents had challenged the proceedings on two grounds: (i) that s.4 read with rule 1 of the Bombay Rules and adopted by the State of Gujarat require a personal notice of intention to acquire under s.4(1), and (ii) that under s.9(3) of the Act also individual notice is necessary;
 but in the present case, after the award was made, the respondents accepting the award filed a suit against the landlord who was a party to the acquisition proceedings and obtained a decree for their share of the compensation and, therefore, the objection under s.9(3) no longer survives, that the High Court in a subsequent decision in the case of Vasudev Chunilal Pancholi v. State of Gujarat and Ors. held that individual notice under s.4(1) read with Rule 1 is not necessary, and, therefore, Rule 1 of the rules framed under s.55 could not go beyond the requirement under s.4(1) and to that extent the rule is bad in law.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : There are no words in Rule 1 indicating a personal notice. What Rule 1 contemplates is a notice to the interested parties as required under s.4(1) and s.4(1) requires the notice to be notified at a convenient place in the locality for information of the interested parties. It is, therefore, clear that by reading s.4(1) with Rule 1 it could not be interpreted to mean that a personal notice to each and every interested person is the requirement of s.4 and in absence of such a notice the proceedings of acquisition will be invalidated. [877 E-G] In the instant case, the procedure laid down in s.4(1) of the Act was followed and, therefore, it could not be said that the notice as contemplated under s.4(1) read with Rule 1 was not given to parties interested and, therefore, it could not be held that the proceedings of acquisition are bad in law. [878 A-B] Ashokkumar Gordhanbhai v. State of Gujarat & Ors., 10 Gujarat Law Reporter 503 overruled.
 Vasudev Chunilal Pancholi v. State of Gujarat and Ors., 25(2) Gujarat Law Reporter 844 and Bai Malimabu etc. v.
 State of Gujarat & Ors., A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 515 approved.
