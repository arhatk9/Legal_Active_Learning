 Section 32(2) of the U.P. Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1949 provides that no proceeding for recovery of any sum payable under the Act, shall be commenced after the expiration of one year from the date on which the last instalment falls due.
 The assessee was assessed to agricultural income-tax under Act, for different assessment years. As the assessee defaulted in the payments the assessing authority made orders directing the Tahsildar to realise the sums as arrears of land revenue. All these orders except one were made within a year of the last date for the payment of the instalments due. But the Tahsildar issued the recovery orders after the expiry of one year of the last date for the payment of the instalments due. On the question, whether the proceedings for recovery were barred by time, this Court, 
HELD : The proceedings were not barred by time except the one in which the order of the assessing authority directing the Collector to realise the sum was made beyond one year from the date the last instalment fell due.
 The proceedings for recovery commence with the making of the request by the assessing authority to the Collector for recovery of the arrears as an arrear of land revenue' There is hardly any difference between the provisions of s. 32 of the Act and the corresponding provisions of s. 46 of the Income-tax Act, 1922. Both these statutes relate to taxation of income and the provisions in question are in pari materia although the words employed may not be exactly the same.
