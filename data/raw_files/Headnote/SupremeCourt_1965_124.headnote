 The appellants were tenants who held over after the expiry of their lease and built structures on the land in breach of a covenant not to build. In a suit for their ejectment they asked the Court to direct the landlord to sell the land to them under s. 9 of the Madras City Tenants Protection Act, 1922 which had, pending the, suit, been extended to the area. The benefit under s. 9 was available to tenants who were entitled under s. 3 to compensation for their structures. According to s. 3 every tenant would on ejectment be entitled to be paid as compensation the value of any building which may have been erected by him. The appellants claim to the benefit under s. 9 was accepted by the trial Court, the First appellate Court and a single Judge of the High Court. But in the Letters Patent Appeal the Division Bench took the view that since a covenant not to build is enforceable in law and a superstructure in contravention of it is liable to be demolished it would be anomalous to compensate the tenant under s. 3 for such a structure, and therefore s. 3 could not be applicable to tenants who built structures in breach of their covenant.
 It also took note of the words in the preamble that the Act was intended to protect tenants who had constructed buildings on others lands "in the hope that they would not be evicted.," 
HELD : (i) The covenant entered into by the tenants could not be taken into account for the purpose of construing the scope of s. 3. The High Court had fallen into this error. [1 15F] (ii)The word 'tenant" in s. 3 must be understood only in the sense that the word is defined in the Act. There is no reason for saying that the word 'tenant' in s. 3 excludes tenants who put up structures on the land in breach of a.
 covenant not to build. [114 C-D] (iii)A covenant not to buid, if it could affect the right of the tenant to claim compensation under s. 3, would be of no effect for under s. 12 nothing in any contract shall take away a tenant's rights under the Act. Thereforein spite of the covenant the tenants were entitled to their rights under s.3 and s. 9. [114 F-G] (iv) Since the language of s. 2(4) and ss. 3 and 9 was clear and unambiguous there was no need to resort to the preamble for interpreting these sections. A preamble cannot operate to annul a section. [115 C-D] N. Vajrapani Naidu v. New Theatre Carnatic Talkies Ltd., [1964] INSC 54; A.I.R. (1964) S.C. 1440, referred to.
 Per Hidayatullah, J. (i) Section 3 is general and applies to every tenant and would include all and sundry tenants as also tenants holding,met. [117D] 111 (ii)The kind of building hinted at in the preamble namely, one constructed "in the hope" of the continuance of the tenancy does not find any mention in the operative part of the Act or in the definition of building. It is therefore difficult to read this limitation (as was contended) in ss. 3 and 9 where 'building' is used without any qualification and implies only a constructions [118 F-G] Deo v., Brandling[1828] EngR 51; , (1828) 7 B & C, 643, referred to.
 (iii)Sections 3 and 9 are imperative and s. 9 is expressly made applicable to pending suits in ejectment such as the present one. Appellants made application under s. 9 within the time limited therefor. The result must obviously follow unless the latter part of s. 12 could save the respondent. That could only be if the stipulations by the tenant not to build had been 'in writing registered', but the lease-deed in question, though in writing, is not registered. [119 B-C]
