 Section 233 of the Gujarat Municipality Act empowered the Chief Officer of the Municipality to evict persons from municipal premises.
 Respondent No. 1 in the appeals was required by a notice in pursuance of the provisions of section 233(1) of the Act to hand over possession of a piece of land to the Municipality on the ground that he was in unauthorised occupation thereof. The respondent assailed the notice in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution, and the only point in controversy was whether or not section 233 of the Act under which the proceedings for eviction were taken was constitutionally valid. The High Court in view of a previous decision of that court held that section 233 being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution was ultra vires.
 In the appeals to this Court it was contended on behalf of the respondents: (1) that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporations case was not correctly decided because though in Chhaganlal Maganlal's case there was a right to appeal to a Civil Court and the right to take evidence was given by the Statute concerned, in the former, the relevant statute contained no such provisions, and (2) that the provisions of the Gujarat Act were violative of Article 19 of the Constitution.
 Allowing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD : (1)(i) The judgment of the High Court is set aside and the order of the Chief Officer dated 9-3-66 affirmed. [1090G] (ii) In the case of Northern Indian Caterers' Private Limited v. State of Punjab and others. [1967] INSC 88; [1967] 3 SCR, 399, this Court while considering a statute whose provisions were almost similar to those of section 233 of the Gujarat Act took the same view as the High Court and struck down the Statute. This decision held the field until it was ultimately overruled in the case of Chhaganlal Maganlal[1974] INSC 91; , [1975] 1 SCR 1. In a later decision in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and others v. Raman Lal Govind Ram and others [1975] INSC 72; [1975] 3 SCR 935, this Court while following the case of Chhaganlal Maganlal upheld a provision of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation (Gujarat Amendment) Act, 1963 which was in pari materia with section 233 of the Gujarat Act. [1090A-C] (iii) Once the property belonging to the Government or semi-Government bodies is held to fall within a particular class and therefore a reasonable classification, whether a civil remedy is given or not would not be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. [1090D-E] 15-138SCI/80 1088 (iv) Under Section 236, the respondents have a right to file an appeal to the Government against the impugned order of eviction. This section also contains a specific provision under which the delay can be condoned if sufficient cause is shown to the satisfaction of the appellate authority namely the Government. It will be open to the respondent to file an appeal which will be disposed of by the Government in accordance with law. [1090G-H, 1091A] (2) The contention that the provisions of the Gujarat Act were violative of Article 19 of the Constitution was expressly considered and negatived in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation & ors. v. Ramanla Govindaram & Ors. [1090E-F]
