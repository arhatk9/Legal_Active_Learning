 The respondent complies were carrying on transport business in the eastern part of the country in co-operation with each other, which continued even after the partition of India. The main traffic of the company in the years 1949 to 1952 was as before, namely, (a) traffic within India; (b) traffic with' 457 Pakistan and (c) traffic between India and Pakistan. The major portion of the large fleet of vessels in which the companies carried on their business remained in common use for traffic origaniting in Pakistan and for traffic originating in West Bengal and Assam, so that no appreciable part of the fleet could be classed as being in use specifically in one country or the other. The workmen claimed bonus for all the four years and the dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal. The workmen's claim was rejected by the Tribunal and the order was confirmed by the Labour Appellate Tribunal. On appeal by special leave, the main controversy between the parties in this Court was whether, the Full Bench Formula has to be applied on the basis of the overall results of the companies operations in India and Pakistan or on the results of the operaeions india only. The appellants main contention was that assuming that the operation in India and Pakistan formed parts of one integrated industrial activity, a way should still he found for separating the two sets of operations for the purpose of the application of the Full Bench Formula.
 Held that in the present case, on applying the tests laid down by this Court, the operations of a company carrying on transport business between two different places cannot be said to be carried on as different and distinct industrial activities at these two places.

 Its Work -men, 1962 (1) L. L. J. 388, referred to.
 Held further, that in the present case on the materials on record, this court was not in a position to apply the Full Bench Formula to a part only of the total operations of the companies in India and Pakistan and the Labour Appellate Tribunal was right in rejecting the workmen's claim for bonus for the years 1949 to 1952.
 Subject to the protection of s. 21 of the Industrial Disputes Act and in the absence of any special circumstances, the Tribunal, in its judicial discretion would ordinarily be justified in asking the employees to give to the workmen reasonable access to all relevant papers.
 458 In the present case however, even if the account books were made available to the workmen, it would be impossible on the materials on record to arrive at proper figures for the different items involved in the Full Bench Formula. The appeals therefore, must be dismissed.
