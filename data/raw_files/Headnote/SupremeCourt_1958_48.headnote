 The lessors granted a lease of a parcel of land to the lessees for 21 years at a rent of Rs. 50 per month. Under the terms of the lease the lessees were to construct a double storeyed building on the land at a cost of not less than Rs. 10,000. The construction had to be to the satisfaction of the lessors' engineers, and the building had to be insured for at least Rs. 12,000 in the joint names of the lessors and the lessees with an insurance firm approved by the lessors. In case of damage or destruction the building was to be repaired out of the money received from the insurance company. On the termination of the lease either at the end Of 21 years or earlier, the lessees were to surrender and yield up the demised premises including the building with its fixtures and appurtenances to the lessors without any compensation for the same. After the expiry of the 21 years the lessors filed a suit for a declaration that they were entitled to the building, and were entitled to claim possession of the same and to recover the rents and profits thereof. The lessees pleaded that they were also lessees of the building and were protected from eviction therefrom by the provisions of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Control Act, 1947 and that the covenant for delivery of possession of the building could not be enforced as the lease in respect of the land could not be terminated on account of the protection given by the Act.
 Held, that upon a proper construction of the lease there was a demise only of the land and not of the building and conse- quently the provisions of the Act did not apply to the contract for delivery of possession of the building. The ownership in the building was with the lessees and in which the lessors had no right while the lease subsisted. There was no absolute rule of law in India that whatever was affixed or built on the soil became part of it, and was subject to the same rights of property as tile soil itself.
 Narayan Das Khettry v. Jatindra Nath Roy Chowdhury, (1926) 54 I.A. 218 and Vallabhdas Narranji v. Development Officer, Bandra (1928) 56 I.A. 259 followed.
 102 800 Held, further, that the provisions of the Act did not provide for a continuation of the lease beyond the specified period stated therein. The Act merely gave to the lessee who continued in possession even after the expiry of tile period of the lease the status of a statutory tenant and protected him from eviction.
