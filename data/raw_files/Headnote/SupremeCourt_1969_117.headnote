 In 1963 the appellant took certain premises on lease. At that time the Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1959 was in force. After the coming into force of the Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965 the landlord brought an application before the Rent Control Court of Kottayam for the eviction of the appellant on two grounds, namely, (1) that he required the premises for his own use and occupation, (2) that the appellant had sublet the premises. The Controller decided against the landlord on both grounds. In appeal the Subordinate Judge held that there was no subleting but that the landlord's personal requirement was genuine and on the later ground ordered eviction of the appellant from part of the premises in question. Both parties went in revision to the District Judge under s. 20 of the Act. The District Judge upheld the order for eviction of the appellant on the ground of subleting. In revision under s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure the High Court refused to interfere whereupon the appellant by special leave came to this Court.
 The appellant contended : (1) that it was provided in s. 11 (I) of the 1965 Act that proceedings for the eviction of tenants could be under the procedure of the new Act only;
 (2) that s. 11(4) provided for eviction of tenants only in respect of sub-letting after the coming into force of the new Act whereas the alleged sub-letting by the appellant took place before; (3) that though s. 34(1) provided for the application of s. 4 of the Interpretation and General Clauses Act, 1125, the proviso to s. 34(1) showed a contrary intention (4) that there was no "corresponding provision" in the 1959 Act within the meaning of s. 34(1) of the new Act;
 (5) that in any case the District Judge in revision under s.
 20 could not sit as a court of appeal and disturb the concurrent finding of fact by the Rent Controller and the Subordinate Judge that there was no sub-letting of the premises by the appellant.
 
HELD : (i) The contention that S. 4 of the Interpretation and General Clauses Act, 1125 was not applicable because a different intention appeared from s. 34(1) of the Act of 1965 could not be accepted. The proviso to s. 34(1) laid down that a legal proceeding which could have been insti- tuted, continued or enforced under the repealed Act of 1959 may be instituted under the corresponding provisions of the new Act. The corresponding provision in the 1959 Act was s.
 11(4) which provided for eviction in case of sub-letting by the tenant without the consent of the landlord. "To correspond" means to "be in harmony with or be similar, analogous to". It does not mean to "be identical with".
 Therefore by virtue of s. 34(1) the appellant was liable to be evicted after the new Act as well. [348 H-349 F] (ii) The words of s. 20 of the Act of 1965 are much wider than those in s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Under s. 20(1) the District Court is empowered to call for and examine the records relating to any 346 order passed or proceedings taken under the Act for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality, regularity or propriety of such order or proceedings and pass such order in reference thereto as it thinks fit. On the words of the section it could not be held that a 'revision is limited to a mere question of jurisdiction. In any event the order of the District Judge was confirmed by the High Court and this Court will not examine whether the revision was properly heard and disposed of by the District Judge.
 [349 H-350 D] (iii) On the facts there was sufficient evidence to hold that there was sub-letting of part of the premises. This Court will also not interfere with the concurrent findings of the District Judge and the High Court in this regard.
