 The expression industrial dispute " in the Industrial Dis- putes Act, 1947, includes disputes between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be regarded as analogous to the carrying on of a trade or business. " Undertaking " in the first part of the definition and " industrial occupation or avocation" in the second part obviously mean much more than what is ordinarily understood by trade or business. The definition was apparently intended to include within its scope what might not strictly be called a trade or business venture.
 Where the chairman of a municipality -dismissed two of its employees, namely, the Sanitary Inspector and the Head Clerk, and-the Municipal Workers' Union, of which these two employees were members questioned the propriety of the dismissal and claimed that they should be re-instated and the matter was referred by the Government to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication under the Industrial Disputes Act, and an objection was raised by the municipality that the dispute was not an industrial dispute:
 Held, that the definition of " industrial dispute " in the said Act was -wide enough to cover the dispute in question and the matter could properly be referred to a Tribunal for adjudication under the said Act.
 Held also, that though the power of a Tribunal under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, to reinstate its employees trenches on the power to appoint and dismiss employees conferred on the chairman of a municipality by ss. 66 and 67 of the Bengal Municipal Act and there is thus an invasion on the provincial field of legislation, the Industrial Disputes Act is not invalid on this ground as it is in pith and substance a law in respect of industrial and labour disputes, which is a central subject.
