 During the years 1942 to 1948 the dealings in shares of the assessee included dealings in shares of Elphinstone Mills and the profit and loss in the dealings of the Mills was taken by the assessee to its revenue account. M was in control of the assessee-company and he also purchased the control and managing agency of the Mills, and in this managing agency company the assessee was also a share holder. From 1949 onwards the assessee did not sell the shares of the Mills but added to its holding. In 1953, M sold the entire shares in the Mills with him and under his control including that with the assessee. Along with that M got the vendee and the latter's nominee appointed directors and also got the resignation of the Managing agency-company from the managing agency of the Mill. Out of the total sale Price the assessee received certain amount which was in excess of the cost price of the shares. The assessee did not show the excess amount on the sale of these shares in its profit and loss account but took it to the capital reserve account and showed it as a capital reserve in its balance-sheet. The assessee, in appeal, contended that (i) the excess amount received was a capital accretion on the sale of the shares and did not represent income from business in shares; and (ii) the excess amount over and above the market price was paid for the controlling interest which was being transferred along with the shares.
 HELD : The appeal must be dismissed.
 (i) The profit made by the assessee on the sale of the shares was its business income. During the years 1943-48 the profits and losses in these shares had been treated on the same footing as the profit and losses in other shares of the assessee. The circumstance that from 1949 onwards the assessee had not sold the shares of the Mills, but had added to its holding, was not in itself sufficient to reach an inference that the assessee had treated its holding in the shares an investment. During the years 1949-53 the shares had slumped in price and this may be the reason why the assessee did not effect any sales during this period. It was not unreasonable to think that the assessee who was a dealer in shares was making further purchases and accumulating its holding when the market was falling so as to be in a position to sell the shares to its advantage when a suitable opportunity occurred. There was no material on the record to suggest that the main object of the assessee in acquiring the shares was to give support to the Managing Agents. When the managing agency was acquired, there was no need to make any use of the holding of the assessee because the assessee at that time had hardly any shares. Subsequent to the acquisition of the managing agency, until it was relinquished, the managing agency never felt its existence either precarious or in need Of support.

 (ii) No part of the amount received by the assessee could be regarded as consideration for any other valuable right excepting the price of the shares sold by it. No controlling power was held by the assessee itself in the Mills and it was not in a position to procure the resignation of the Directors or bring about the appointment of vendee's nominees as Directors. Nor was it In a position to call upon the Managing Agents to relinquish their offices. All these things were possible to M because of the influence and power he possessed. The part taken by the assesses in the transaction with the vendee was merelv a passive part, viz., keeping at the disposal of M its holding in the Mills' share, which it had held in its business is a dealer in shares. Therefore, so far as the assessee was concerned, what it parted with was the shares which it held and what it received was the payment for those shares. [491 D-F]
