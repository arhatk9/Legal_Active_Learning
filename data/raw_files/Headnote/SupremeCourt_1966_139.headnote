 The appellant who held out as a pucca adatia made a public advertisement inviting people to enter into forward transactions through him. He further said in his advertisement that he undertook forward business in accordance with pucca adatia system and according to the usual practice and usage of the various associations concerned. One of his constituents made a complaint against him on e allegation that by his false representation that he was entitled to lawfully conduct forward business he had induced the complainant to part with money. The appellant was not a member of any of the recognised associations whose members were entitled to carry on forward business. The prosecution of the appellant was under s. 420 of the Indian Penal Code and s. 21 of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 (74 of 1952). In his defence the appellant said that he carried out the transactions in question through members of the recognised associations as an agent of the complainant. The trial court convicted him and the conviction was upheld by the Session Judge and the High Court, whereupon with special leave an appeal was filed in this Court.
 
HELD : (i) From the evidence it was clear that the complainant would not have parted with his money but for the inducement contained in the appeals advertisement and his false representation that he could lawfully carry on forward contract business. The offence under s. 420 I.P.C.was therefore proved. [141 C-D] It was not necessary that a false pretence should be made in express words for s. 420 I.P.C. to be applicable. It may be inferred from all the circumstances including the; conduct of the person charged. [141 B-C) (ii) The speculative contracts entered into by the appellant with the complainant fell within the definition of 'forward contracts' within the meaning of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1962. If such contracts were not included within the definition of 'forward contract' in s. 2(c) of the Act the very object of the Act which was passed in order to put a stop to undesirable forms of speculation in forward trading and to correct the abuses of certain forms of forward trading in the wide interests of the community and in particular of the consumers would be defeated.

 (iii) There was no evidence on record to show that the appellant placed the order for the notified good with a member of a recognized 139 association. But even on the assumption that the appellant placed an order for the notified goods through a member of a recognised association there was a breach of the provisions of the Act. The appellant was doing forward contract business as a pucca adatia. It is well established that the pucca adatia has no authority to pledge the credit of the upcountry constituent to the Bombay merchant and there is no privity of contract between the upcountry constituent and the Bombay merchant. The pucca adatia is entitled to substitute his own goods towards the contract made for the principal and buy the principal's goods in his personal account. In other words the pucca adatia is acting as a principal as regards his constituent and not as a disinterested middleman to bring the two principals together. The appellant was acting as principal to principal so far as the complainant was concerned and the contracts were hit by s. 15 of the 1952 Act. [145 B-F] Bhagwandas Narotwndas v. Kanji Deoji, I.L.R. 30 Bom. 205 and Bhagwandas Parasram v. Burjorio Ruttonji Bomanji, 45 I.A.

 (iv) The appellant was represented at the trial by eminent counsel and there was no prejudice caused to him by the fact that the trial was conducted in Tamil and English both of which he did not know. The breach of S. 361 Criminal Procedure Code was only an irregularity curable under s.537 of the Code. [146 C-D]
