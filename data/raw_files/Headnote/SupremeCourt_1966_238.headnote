 Three brothers entered into a partnership in 1949 for doing business. Clause 3 of the partnership deed provided that the capital allotted to each partner was equal, and cl. 10 provided that after meeting all the expenses, interest and other charges, the resulting net profit or loss should be ascertained and divided amongst all the partners. In the assessment year 1951-52, the three partners applied to the Income-tax Officer for registration of the firm under s. 26A of the Income-tax Act, 1922 and registration was granted.
 For the assessment year 1952-53, the registration was re- newed on application. But for the assessment year 1953-54 the Incometax Officer refused renewal. In all the applications for registration, the three partners were shown to have shared the profits equally, and in their account books also, since 1949, the profits have been apportioned equally. The ground of refusal by the Income-tax Officer was, that there was no clause in the deed specifying the individual share of profits of each partner as required by s. 26A. The order was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court on reference.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The assessee firm was entitled to be registered under s. 26A of the Act for the assessment year 1953-54 also.
 [1003 D] Although the application for registration had to be strictly in conformity with the section and Rules, in ascertaining whether the application was in such conformity the partnership deed has to be reasonably construed. Reading the partnership deed as a whole in the light of s. 13 of the Partnership Act, 1932, and in the context of the relevant circumstances of the case, there was specification of the individual shares of the three partners in the profits and losses namely, that each partner was allotted an equal one- third share and there was hence specification of the indivi- dual shares of the partners within the meaning of the section, [1002 D-F] Kylasa Sarabhalah v. Commissioner of Income-tax, [1964] INSC 279; [1965] 2 S.C.R. 310, followed.
