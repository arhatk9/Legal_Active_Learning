 The appellants alongwith their brother Ratti Ram were alleged to have committed the murder of Inder Singh by inflicting serious injuries with lathi and gandasa. The prosecution case was that while he was being assaulted,Inder Singh raised an alarm. upon which his brother Dalip Singh (P.W.2), his wife Dharam Devi (P.W.4) and his son Shamsher Singh (P.W.3) rushed to the scene of the offence but out of fear they had not the courage to go to the rescue of the victim. After (1) (1911) 16 a W. N, 327 398 the assailants left the place, they went near him and found him dead. An information was lodged and after investigation the appellants alongwith their brother were put on trial before the Sessions Judge for an offence under s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code, as a result of which Ratti Ram was acquitted and the appellants were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life. On appeal, the High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence passed against the appellants. The State appeal challenging the acquittal of Ratti Ram was also dismissed. On appeal by special leave the appellants contended that in law the evidence of interested and hostile witnesses cannot be accepted without corroboration and, therefore, the High Court erred in accepting the evidence of the three eyewitnesses.
 Held that on principle it is difficult to accept the plea that if a witness is shown to be a relative of the deceased and it is also shown that he shared the hostility of the victim towards the assailant his evidence can never be accepted unless it is corroborated on material particulars.
 It would be impossible to hold that such witnesses are no better than accomplices and that their evidence, as a matter of law, must receive corroboration before it is accepted.
 That is not to say that the evidence of such witnesses should be accepted lightheartedly without very close and careful examination.
 If the offence has taken place, as in the present case, in front of the house of the victim, the fact that on hearing his shouts, his relations rushed out of the house cannot be ruled out as being improbable, and so, the presence of the three eye-witnesses cannot be properly characterised as unlikely.
 Rameshwar v. The State of Rajasthan, [1951] INSC 61; [1952] S.C.R, 377 Lachman Singh v. The State, [1952] INSC 17; [1952] S.C.R. 839, Karnail Singh v. The. State of Punjab, [1954] S.C.R. 904 and Vaikuntam Chandrappa v. The State of Andhra Pradesh, A.I.R. 1960 S.C.
 1340, held inapplicable.
 Held further, that the powers of the court under s. 540 can and ought to be exercised in the interests of justice when- ever the court feels that the interests of justice so require, but that does not mean that the failure of the court to have exercised its powers under s. 540 has introduced a serious infirmity in the trial itself.
 In the present case, there is no justification for the assumption that any eye-witness has been kept back from the 399 court, and so, the case cannot be sent back on the hypothetical ground that the scrutiny of the police diary may disclose the presence of an independent eye witness.
 The appeal therefore, must be dismissed.
