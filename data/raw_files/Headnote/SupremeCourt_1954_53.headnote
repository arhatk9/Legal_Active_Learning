 Held, that the Supreme Court does not, when hearing appeals under Article 136 of the Constitution, sit as a Court of further appeal on facts, and does not interfere with findings given on a consideration of evidence, unless they are perverse or based on no evidence and this is particularly so when the findings under challenge are those of Election Tribunals.
 The rights under litigation in election proceedings are not common law rights but rights which owe their existence to statutes and the extent of those rights must be determined by reference to the statutes which create them.
 The proviso to section 85 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, does not contemplate the Election Commission giving to the respondent notice of the petition for condonation of the delay, or the holding of an enquiry as to the sufficiency of the grounds in his presence before passing an order under it. The policy underlying the provision is to treat the question of delay as one between the Election Commission and the petitioner, and to make the decision of the Election Commission on the question final and not open to question at any later stage of the proceedings.
 Under section 90(4) of the Act, when the petition does not comply with the requirements of section 81, section 83 or section 117, the Election Tribunal has a discretion either to dismiss it or not, "notwithstanding anything contained in section 85". The scope of the power conferred on the Election Tribunal under section 90(4) is that it overrides the power conferred on the Election Commission under section 86 to dismiss the petition. It does not extend further and include a power in the Election Tribunal to review any order passed by the Election Commission under section 85 of the Act. The words of section 90(4) are, "notwithstanding anything contained in section 85" and not "notwithstanding anything contained in section 85 or any order passed thereunder". An order of the Election Commission under section 85 dismissing a petition as barred will, under the scheme of the Act, be final, and the same result must follow under section 90(4) when the order is one excusing the delay. Section 90(4) will be attracted only when the Election Commission passes the petition on to the Tribunal 141 without passing any order under section 85. If the Election Commission can thus pass a final order condoning delay without notice to the respondent, there is no reason why it should not pass such an order suo motu. In this respect, the position under the proviso to section 85 is materially different from that under section 5 of the Limitation Act, under which an order excusing delay is not final and is liable to be questioned by the respondent at a later stage.
 The proviso advisedly confers on the Election Commission wide discretion in the matter, and the obvious intention of the Legislature was that is should be exercised with a view to do justice to all the parties. The Election Commission might therefore be trusted to pass the appropriate order when there is avoidable and unreasonable delay. That a power might be liable to be abused is no ground for denying it, when the statute confers it, and where there is an abuse of power by statutory bodies the parties aggrieved are not without remedies under the law.
 While the proviso to section 85 requires that "the person making the petition" should satisfy the Election Commission that there was sufficient cause for delay, it does not require that he should do so in person.
