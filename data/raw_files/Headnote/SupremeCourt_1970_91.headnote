 The assessee was a Hindu undivided family. The income-tax Officer determined the total income, of the assessee at a certain figure. Following demonetization of high denomination notes the assessed encashed notes of the value of Rs. 19,000 and each of five members of the family en- cashed certain notes, the total encashed by all the five members being Rs. 1,10,000. The Income-tax Officer reopened the assessments under s. 34 of the Income-tax Act, 1922 (as amended in 1948 and made applicable by reason of s. 31 of the Income-tax Amendment Act, 1953) and completed the reassessment on January 31,,1955. He included Rs. 19,000 in the total income of the family and the 'amounts which bad been separately encashed by the five members were included in the reassessments of their respective individual incomes.
 on February 2, 1955, he issued another notice under s. 34 and after bearing the assessee, included the sum of Rs.
 1,10,000 in the total income of the family.
 On the, question, whether the second notice was competent.
 
HELD : Under s. 34, as it stood at the relevant time, what the Income-tax Officer has to see is if by reason of omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment there had been escapement of income. From the primary facts disclosed by the assessee or discovered by the authority, the authority has to draw inferences as regards other facts and ultimately draw the proper legal inferences.
 In the present case, the primary facts were within the knowledge of the Income-tax Officer at the time when be completed the first reassessment. When he was in possession of all facts and proceeded to make the reassessment by including the, amount in the individual accounts of the members of the family, the escapement has occurred by reason, of the failure of the officer to include the total sum in the assessment of the family. He could not therefore, a few days later, merely changed his opinion and issue the second notice under s. 34 to the family. [286 F- H; 287 A-C] Majority opinion in Calcutta Co.
