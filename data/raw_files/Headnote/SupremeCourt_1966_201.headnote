 The appellant was a partner in a firm in which the other two partners were his wife and a stranger. Two, minor sons of the appellant were also admitted to the benefits of the partnership. Under the partnership deed, the shares of the five persons in the profits were defined and it was also provided that a partner may advance a loan for meeting the expenses of the firm and receive interest on such loan upto 12%. The amounts of profits falling to the shares of the wife and sons were allowed to accumulate in the accounts of the firm. Till the beginning of the accounting year 1956- 57, the profits that were accumulating were kept without any interest, but thereafter the firm allowed interest at 9% per annum. On the question whether the interest could be added to the income of the appellant for purposes of assessment, under s. 16 (3) (a) (i) and (ii) of the Income-tax Act, 1922.
 
HELD : The interest indirectly arose and accrued to the wife and the minor sons because of their capacity mentioned in s.
 16 (3) (a) (i) and (ii) and could therefore be included for assessment in the income of the assessee, under the section.
 [730 F-G] The accumulated profits remaining in the hands of the firm could not be equated with deposits made with or loans advanced to the firm. The wife and minor sons earned the profits because of their membership of the firm or because of their admission to the benefits of the firm., and having earned them in that capacity, they allowed the use of the profits to the firm without any specific arrangement as would have been entered into if the funds belonged to a stranger. They let the firm use the funds because they were interested in the profits of the firm, and interest was allowed on the accumulation simply because the funds belonged either to a partner or to minors admitted to the benefits of the partnership. [730 B, C-D, F] Case law referred to.
