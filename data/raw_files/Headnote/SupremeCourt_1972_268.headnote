 (1) That the usufructuary mortgage of an occupancy holding by a tenant is void and not voidable; (2) that a mortgagor after giving possession to the mortgagee cannot recover possession of the-holding without paying the money which he had taken from the mortgagee; (3) that a mortgagee of an occupancy holding by remaining in possession for over 12 year does not extinguish the rights of the mortgagor to redeem him and by such possession the mortgagee only prescribes for mortgagee rights; (4) that it is open to the mortgagor to seek possession of the holding by tendering the consideration which. he had received and he may do so by a redemption suit; (5) that the relationship which comes into existence as a result of the mortgage of an occupancy holding and its possession being transferred to the mortgagee, is analogous to that of a mortgagor and mortgagee and the action to recover possession is analogous to redemption and (6) such a suit is maintainable suit in a civil court.
 In the present case, the occupancy tenant of the land in dispute executed a mortgage deed in respect of the land in favour of the appellants and put them in possession.
 Respondents 1 to 6 were subsequently accepted as the occupancy tenants by the landlords in place of the previous occupancy tenant and have also been declared to be the Bhumidars of the land. Respondents 1 to 6 filed a suit for possession of the land, after depositing the mortgage money in court.
 The suit was decreed in appeal, by the High Court, following the earlier Full Bench decisions.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) in the matter of the interpretation of a local statute, the view taken by the High Court over a number of years should normally be adhered to and not disturbed. A different view would not only introduce an element of uncertainty and confusion, it would also have the effect of unsettling transactions which might have been entered into on the faith of those decisions. The doctrine of stare decisis can be aptly invoked in such a situation by a superior court riot strictly bound by the decision. [840 B- E] Brownsaa Haven Properties v. Poole Corpn. [1958] Ch. 574 (C.A.) referred to.
 (2) The status of the appellants was analogous to that of the mortgagees and the successor of the original mortgagor would be entitled to 836 recover possession of the land on payment of the mortgage money. As respondents 1 to 6 were the occupancy tenants of the land and as they were declared to be the Bhumidars, they had sufficient interest in the land, to institute the suit under s.91 (a) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
