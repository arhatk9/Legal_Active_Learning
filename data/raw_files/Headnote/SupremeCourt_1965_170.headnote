 The respondents were shareholders in the appellant company.
 As they did not pay the call money on their shares, a notice under Art 29 of the Articles of Association was issued and as the respondents defaulted in the payment demanded, their shares were forfeited under Art. 30. The respondents filed a petition under ss. 402 and 237 of the Companies Act, 1956, and obtained. interim orders directing stay of collection of the moneys and restraining forfeiture of the shares, before the forfeiture by the appellant; but, as the call money was not paid into court as directed the interim order was vacated and the petition was finally dismissed. Thereafter, the respondents filed an application under s. 155 praying that the forfeitures may be set aside -and the necessary rectifications made in the share register. The High Court on its original side and in Patent Appeal allowed the application, holding that the notice under Art. 29 wag defective and therefore the forfeiture was invalid.
 In the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The forfeiture was invalid, and therefore the names of the respondents were omitted from the share register without sufficient cause and the jurisdiction of the High Court under s. 155 was attracted and rightly exercised. [687 B] A proper notice under Art. 29 is a condition precedent to forfeiture under Art. 30. The object of the notice under Art. 29 is to give the shareholder an opportunity for payment of the call money, interest and expenses. In the absence of particulars of expenses, the respondents were not in a position to know the precise amount which they were re- quired to pay and that slight defect in the notice invalidated it and was fatal to the forfeiture. [685 D-G] Section 155(1)(a)(ii) allows rectification of the share register if the name of any person after having been entered in it, is without sufficient cause, omitted therefrom The issue under the section is not whether the shareholder has sufficient cause to approach the Court, but whether his name has been omitted from the register without sufficient cause.
 [686 D: 687 A] Where by reason of its complexity or otherwise the matter can more conveniently be decided in a suit, the court may refuse -relief under s. 155 and relegate the parties to a suit. But having found summaribly that the notice was defective and the forfeiture invalid, the Court could not arbitrarily refuse relief to the respondents. The unwarranted proceedings under ss. 402 and 237 and other vexatious proceedings started by the respondents have no relation to the invalidity of the forfeiture and the -relief of rectification and were not valid grounds for refusing, relief, even if it was an equitable one.
