 The appellant, a B.Sc. Engineering degree-holder in Tele- Communication was appointed as an Assistant Engineer (Tele- Communication) in September 1963 by the Bihar State Electricity Board and was sent abroad to the headquarters of M/s. Brown Boveri and Co. Ltd., Badan, Switzerlind for six months' specialised training in power line carrier, tele- metering and tele-control equipment in the modern power system. On his return the appellant was deputed to look after the entire telecommunication system of the Board. In June 1968, the Board felt the necessity of maintenance of efficient communication service between the vital centres of generation, utilisation and administration for ensuring reliability and continuity in power supply which would facilitate quick supervision and checking of the then existing arrangements oil the generating stations receiving sub-stations and distributing areas as also the necessity of proper supervision and handling by trained and qualified personnel of I large number of wave-change-over communication equipments on 33 KW Transmission line which had been installed in the Tele-Communication SubDivision of the Board at Patna and were maintained and aligned with the help of special electronic instruments. The Board, therefore, accorded Sanction to the creation of a temporary Tele-Communication Division with headquarters at Patna and also to the creation of a temporary post of Executive Engineer (Tele-Communication). As per the recommendation of its expert Selection Committee to the effect that the appellant was fit to be promoted to the rank of the Executive Engineer (Tele-Communication) in view of the fact that he had consistently good record of service, possessed the degree in Tele-Communication Engineering, had undergone special training in Switzerland in TeleCommunication, had ever since his return from Switzerland been satisfactorily performing the onerous and complex duties assigned to him and had been looking after the entire Tele-Communication system of the Board and had thus acquired a valuable practical experience in that field which was necessary to man the post of Executive Engineer (Tele-Communication), the appellant was appointed temporarily on promotion to the post of Executive Engineer (Tele-Communication).Thereupon respondents 3 to 28 who areAssistant Electrical Engineers appointed, as such. earlier to the appellant challenged the said appointment in the Patna High Court averring that the promotion of the appellant was mala fide; they were seniors to the appellant and possessed the requisite qualifications;
 their cases must have been considered by the Board; and their supersession is in violation of guarantee of equality of opportunity enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The High Court quashed the said orders and held that the case of respondents 3 to 28 who were seniors to and had better experience and academic career than the appellant bad been unjustifiably ignored by the Board violating the protection of equal opportunity guaranteed under Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution. In appeal by certificate. respondents 3 to 28 though served did not choose to appear. Respondents 1 and 2 contended : (i) that Tele-Communication is a highly specialized subject quite distinct from that of general electricity-, (ii) that respondents 5 to 28 who were merely graduates of Science in Electrical Engineering were not qualified for the post of Executive Engineer (Tele-Communication). Respondents 788 3 and 4 who had only studied telecommunication as one of the subjects in their final B.Sc. Engineering Examination also were not equally qualified; (iii) that they had no right to maintain the writ petition; and (iv) that there was no question of any breach or violation of the guarantee of equality of opportunity contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The process of rule making is a protracted and complicated one involving consultation with various authorities and compliance with mani fold formalities.
 Exigencies of administration at times require immediate creation of service or posts and any procrastination in that behalf cannot but prove detrimental to the proper and efficient functioning of public departments. In such like situations, the authorities concerned would have the power to appoint or terminate administrative personnel under the general power of administration vested in them. In the absence of rules, qualifications for a post can validly be laid down in the self same executive order creating the service or post and filling it tip according to those qualifications. [792 A-D] B. N. Nagarajan & Ors. v. State of Mysore & Ors. [1966] 3 SCR 682 and T. Cajee v. U. Jormanik Siem & Anr. [1960] INSC 154; [1961] 1 SCR 750 at 764, followed.
 (2)The doctrine of equality before law and equal protection of laws and equality of opportunity in the matter of employment and promotion enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution which is intended to advance justice by avoiding discrimination is attracted only when equals are treated as unequals or where unequals are treated as equals.
 The guarantee of equality does not imply that the same rules should be made applicable in spite of differences in their circumstances and conditions. Although Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution forbid hostile discrimination, they do not forbid reasonable classification and equality of opportunity in matters of promotion means equality as between members of the same class of employees and not equal between members of separate independent classes. Though the concept of equal protection and equal opportunity undoubtedly permeate the whole spectrum of. an individual's employment from appointment through promotion and termina- tion to the payment of gratuity and pension, it has an inherent limitation arising from the very nature of constitutional guarantee. Equality is for equals, that is, who are similarly circumstanced are entitled to an equal treatment but the guarantee enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution cannot be carried beyond the point which is well-settled by a catena of decisions of this Court.

 General Manager, Central Railway & Ors. [1959] INSC 138; [1960] 2 SCR 311, 316--AIR 1960 SC 384, 386, referred to.
 (3) In the instant case :
 (a) The High Court was in error in thinking that respondents 3 to 28 possessed qualifications equal to the appellant or that they were-eligible for the job. [792 G] (b)It is evident from the perusal of the proposal for creation of a TeleCommunication Division at Patna and the aforesaid recommendation made by the Selection Committee in favour of the appellant that for ensuring reliability and continuity in power supply it was absolutely essential that maintenance of the sophisticated wave-change-over communication equipments of 33 KW installed by the Board in the Tele-Communication Sub-Division should be entrusted to specially trained experienced and qualified officer possessing specialised theoretical and practical knowledge of Tele-Communication which is a subject quite distinct from that of general electricity. It was only the appellant who possessed degree in B.Sc. Engineering in Tele-Communication, was separately recruited and specially trained in that line in Switzerland and thus acquired specialised knowledge therein and acquitted himself creditably in the field for 789 five years who could be said to possess the requisite qualification and be considered fit and suitable for the job in question and not any one of the respondents 5 to 28 who were mere graduates in electrical engineering or respondents 3 and 4 who had studied tele communication only as one of the subjects in their final B.Sc. Engineering Examination.
 [792 A-G] (c)The qualification required for the post of Executive Engineer (Telecommunication) as demonstrably reflected in the proposal for creation-of that post and the aforesaid recommendation of the Selection Committee setting out various factors which went in favour of the promotion of the appellant appear to be founded on reasonable classification having an intelligible differential which distinguished the appellant from respondents 3 to 28 and the differentia had a reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved.
 [795 D-E] Respondents 3 to 28 had no. legal right which they could claim to have been denied to them by an authority which had a legal duty to do something. The High Court was not right in issuing the writ of mandamus. [795 E] Mani Subrat Jain & Ors. v. State of Haryana & Ors. [1976] INSC 319; [1977] 1 SCC 486, applied.
 The criterion employed by the concerned authority in promoting the appellant was not arbitrary or capricious but was intended to increase the efficiency in the functioning of the department. It was not based on extraneous or irrelevant considerations or suffered from any other vice.
