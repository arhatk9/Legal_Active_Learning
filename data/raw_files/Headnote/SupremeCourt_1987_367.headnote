 % The appellants-landlords, residents of the State of Bihar, carrying on business in Meghalaya, sought eviction of the tenant from their suit shop in Arrah, Bihar on the ground of default in payment of rent as well as on the ground of bona fide need, and for arrears of rent under s.12(1) of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1977. Their case was that the tenant had not paid the rent for the period of default and that due to disturbances in Meghalaya their business was completely disturbed and some of the children of the family, who had grown up, were sitting idle. They, therefore, wanted to do their business in the suit shop which laws adjacent to their residential house and there was a connecting door. E The tenant took the plea that he had sent the money- order to their village address, and that there was no evidence to show that there was no other house available to the landlord from which his need could not be met.
 The Trial Court came to the conclusion that the tenant was a defaulter. He had full knowledge about the fact that the landlord and her family members did not reside at the said village. So, even if the rent had been sent that could not be a valid tender. It further found that the case of the landlord about personal necessity was proved. The findings of the trial court were armed by the First Appellate Court.
 These findings were, however, reversed by the High Court in second appeal, which took the view that there was no evidence on record to show that the tenant knew the proper address to which remittance could have been made, and that there was no evidence of disturbances in Meghalaya.
 254 Allowing the appeal by special leave, ^ 
 HELD: 1. It was not open to the High Court in second appeal to interfere with the concurrent findings of facts of the first two courts both on default and bona fide need of the landlord. [259D] 
 2. The respondent-tenant was a habitual defaulter. Even after the knowledge of the proper address he had been deliberately remit ting the rent to a wrong address. There was, therefore, no valid tender. [256A-B] 
 3. The appellants-landlords have been living and doing business in Meghalaya where there was disturbance and it was difficult for them to have residence there. They allege that they have bona fide reasonable need of the suit shop for doing their business, which was adjacent to their residential house in Arrah and there was a connecting door.
 There were grown up sons doing no business. There was no evidence that there was some vacant premises which the landlord could conveniently occupy. The first two courts, therefore, in acting on the basis of the reasonable need cannot be said to have committed any such irregularity which could have been interfered with by the High Court in second appeal.
