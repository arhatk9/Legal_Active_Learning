 Before a magistrate cancels a declaration under s. 8B of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867, he has to give a notice and opportunity to the person concerned to show cause against the action proposed and hold an enquiry. If he is thereafter satisfied that (a) the newspaper is published in contravention of the provisions of the Act or rules made thereunder, or (b) the newspaper bears a title which is the same as, or similar to, that of any other newspaper either in the same language or in the same State, or (c) the printer or publisher has ceased to be its printer or publisher, or (d) the declaration was made on false representation or concealment of any material fact, he may cancel the declaration. [971 C-F] In the present case, the petitioner gave the title 'Blitzkrieg' as his first preference for the title of his newspaper and the magistrate authenticated the declaration as required by s. 6 of the Act. Thereafter, the magistrate cancelled the declaration on the ground that the title is the same as that of 'Blitz' without giving any opportunity to the petitioner.
 In a petition under Art. 32, 
HELD : (1) The order of cancellation should be quashed. [972 B] (a) It violated the petitioner's fundamental rights to carry on the occupation of editor and the business of publishing a newspaper. [972 A-B] (b) The order was passed with unseemly haste without giving any opportunity to the petitioner. [971 H] (2) The Second notice given to the petitioner during the pendency of the writ proceedings should also be quashed as the titles 'Blitzkrieg' and 'Blitz' are totally different titles and there is no ground for cancellation of the declaration. [971 G-H; 972 B-C]
