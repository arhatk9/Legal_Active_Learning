 The appellant was the owner of certain land and the first respondent was the protected lessee. In 1963, the appellant filed a petition for possession of the land on the ground that the first respondent failed to exercise his right of purchase under s. ' 41(1) of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Land (Vidharbha and Kutch Area) Act, 1958. The authorities under the Act held that the tenant had become a statutory owner from April 1, 1961, under s. 46(1) and dismissed the petition. In the High Court the appellant raised for the first time, the contention that under s.
 42(c) of the Act the appellant should have been left an area not less than one family holding (that is about 26 -acres), that s, 46(1) was applicable only when the condition in s.
 42(c) was satisfied, that under s. 43(14A), which was introduced into the Act by Act 2 of 1962. the first respondent should take steps to exercise his right of purchase. and since the first respondent did not do so, he must be deemed to have surrendered the land to the appellant under s. 43(14A). The High Court did not accept the contention.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) The appellant was not entitled to raise any contention based on s. 42(c) as no foundation was laid for doing so in the pleadings or at any prior state till the matter reached the High Court. [814 A-B] (2) The operation of s. 46(1) was not affected by the subsequent insertion of sub-s. 14A in s. 43, as it did not have any retrospective operation. Therefore, the first respondent had become a statutory owner of the land in his tenancy under s. 46(1), on April 1, 1961, even though he did not take any steps to purchase that land from the appellant.
