 Section 7-A(1 ) of Tamilnadu General Sales-tax Act, 1959, provides that every dealer who in the course of his business purchases from registered dealer or from any other person, any goods (the sale or purchase of' which is liable to tax under this Act) in circumstances in which no tax is payable under section 3, 4 or 5, as the case may be, and either, (a) consumes such goods in the manufacture of other goods for sale or otherwise; or (b) disposes of such goods in any manner other than by way of sale in the State. Or (c) despatches them to a place outside the state except as a direct result of sale or purchase in the course of inter- State trade or commerce shall pay tax on the turnover relating to the purchase aforesaid at the rate mentioned in s. 3, 4 or 5 as the case may be whatever be the quantum of such turnover in a year: The proviso to this sub-section exempts dealer (other than a casual trader or agent of a non resident dealer), if his turnover for a year is less than Rs. 25,000/-.
 All the respondents are dealers against whom either pre-assessment proceedings have been initiated or assessments have been made under s. 7-A of the Act on the purchase turnover of goods like arecanuts, Gingelly seeds, butter turmeric and grams and castor seeds. All the respondents filed writ petitions under Art. 226 of the constitution in the High court of Madras challenging the validity of the pre-assessment proceedings assessments and the demand notices. The High court allowed the writ petitions and quashed the impugned proceedings and assessments. The State has preferred this appeal on the basis of the certificate granted by the High Court under Art. 133(1)(c) of the Constitution It was contended for the appellant that the High Court was wrong in taking the view that the expression "goods the sale or purchase of which is liable to tax under this Act" and the phrase "purchases.. in circumstances in which no tax is payable under section 3, 4 or 5" are a contradiction in terms and therefore, s. 7-A(1) being far from clear as to its intention, the Joint-commercial Tax officer was not justified in involving this section.
 Accepting the contention and allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: (1) Section 7-A at once a charging as well as a remedial provision. its main object is to plug leakage and prevent evasion of tax. In interpreting such a provision, a construction which would defeat its purpose and, in effect, obliterate it from the statute book, should be eschewed. If more than one construction is possible, that which preserves its workability and efficacy is to be preferred to the one which would render it otiose or sterile. [46F-G] (ii) The scheme of the Act involves three inter-related but distinct concepts namely, taxable person', 'taxable goods' and 'taxable event'. All the three must be satisfied before a person can be saddled with liability under the Act.
 The ingredients of-section 7-A(1) are: (1) The person who purchases the goods is a dealer: (2) The purchase is made by him in the course of his business; (3) Such purchase is either from "a registered dealer or from any other person;
 (4) The goods purchased are goods the sale or purchase of 39 which is liable to tax under this Act." (5) Such purchase is "in circumstances in which no tax is payable under s. 3, 4 or 5 as the case may be", and (6) The dealer either. (a) consumes such goods in the manufacture of other goods for sale or otherwise or (b) despatches all such goods in any manner other than by way of sale in the State or (c) despatches them to place outside the State except as a direct result of sale or purchase in the course of inter state trade or commerce. Section 7-h can be involved only if all these ingredients are cumulatively satisfied [43F; 42G- H; 43A-B] (iii) Ingredients (4) and (5) are not mutually exclusive and the existence of one does not necessarily negate the other. Both can co-exist and in harmony.
 Ingredient (4) would be satisfied if it is shown that the particular goods were 'taxable goods' i.e.., the goods the sale or purchase of which is generally taxable under the Act. Notwithstanding the goods being 'taxable goods' there may be circumstances in a given case, by reason of which the particular sale or purchase does not attract tax under 9. 3, 4 or S. Section 7-A provides for such a situation and makes the purchase of such goods taxable in the hands of the purchasing dealer on his purchase turnover if any of the conditions (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) of s. 7-A is satisfied. [44G-H] (iv) The goods in question are 'taxable goods. The sales of arecanuts, Gingelly Seeds, turmeric and gram were not liable to tax in the hands of the sellers as they were agriculturists and the goods were the produce of the crops raised by them. Similarly , butter was purchased by the assessee concerned directly from the house holders whose sales are not liable to tax under the Act. Caster-seeds are said to have been purchased by the assessee concerned from unregistered dealers under bought notes If this is a fact, then such sales may not be liable to tax under the Act. In all these cases, the purchases have been made by the dealers of goods, the sale or purchase of which is generally liable to tax under the act, but because of the circumstances prescribed under the Act no tax was suffered in respect or the sale of these goods by the sellers. If it is a tact that the Gingelly seeds and Castor seeds were crushed into oil and the butter was converted into ghee by the purchasers dealers concerned. the condition in clause (a) of section 7- A(1) would be satisfied and s. 7-A would be attracted. If in the case of arecanuts, turmeric and gram, the purchasers dealers transported these goods outside the State for sale on consignment basis, their case would also be covered by clause (b) or (c) of s. 7-A(1) and such dealers would be liable to tax on the purchase-turnover of these goods.
