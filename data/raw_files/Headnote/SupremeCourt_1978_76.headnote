 Before the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals Alienated) Act, 1950, came into force on 31st March, 1951, the plaintiff predecessor of the appellant and who is a brother of the second respondent and the proprietor of Ahiri estate, took a forest contract Ex. P.
 19 on 15th March, 1951 for cutting the standing trees in the forest known as Huchbodi Nendwadi coupe for a sum of Rs.
 50,000/-. The contract provided that a sum of Rs. 15,000 was to be paid immediately on the date of the execution of the contract and the balance to be paid within six months.
 After the dismissal, on 2nd, May, 1952 of the writ petition filed by the second respondent, challenging. the validity of the Act, the departments of the Government refused permission to the original plaintiff to remove the trees cut. The plaintiff made representation to the State Government and the State Government by its letter dated 12th March, 1953 Ex. P.-17, permitted the plaintiff to remove the trees on condition that he deposited Rs. 35,000/-.
 Accordingly the plaintiff paid Rs. 35,000/- on 24th March 1953 and removed the timber. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a suit for the return of the said sum of Rs. 35,000/- on the ground that he had already paid Rs. 35,000/- to his brother on 30th September, 1951, with interest of Rs.
 7,000/- in all Rs. 42,000/- contending that as the Supreme Court had granted a stay of the operation of the Act, the property did not vest in the State on 31st March 1951 but only on 2nd May, 1952, when the Supreme Court dismissed the writ petition and therefore the contract was binding on the defendant's estate, making his title perfect on the date of the contract before 31st March, 1951 when the estate vested in the State. The trial Court decreed the suit on 21st November 1959 holding that the transaction was entered into by the second respondent in the ordinary course of management and that the transaction was not sham or a bogus one and that the transfer of sale under the contract of the standing timber was sale of movable property and, therefore, the transaction did not contravene the provisions of s. 6 of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950.
 The High Court of Bombay, (Nagpur Bench) allowed the appeal by the State, set aside the decree passed by the trial Court and dismissed the suit of the original plaintiff.
 Dismissing the appeal by Certificate, the Court 
HELD : 1. While under Section 3 of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 the interest of the proprietor vests in the State Government from the date specified in the Notification i.e. 31st March, 1951 Section 6 provides that the transfer of any right which is liable to vest in the State under this Act made by the proprietor at any time after 16th March, 1950 shall be void from the date of vesting. The result of the operation of Section 6 would be that the contract dated 15th March, 1951 which is a transfer of a right of property which is liable to vest in the State having been made by the proprietor after 16th March, 1950, shall become void from the date of vesting i.e. 31st March, 1951. [581 G-H, 582 A] 
2. (a) The several clauses of the contract Ex. P. 19 clearly show that the contract was to commence on 15th March, 1951 and will be in force till 14th March, 1953 during which period the contractor agreed to file monthly 579 accounts of falling, logging and extraction by him. As per Cl. 5, the contractor will not remove the forest produce till logs are checked and passed by the Estate Forest Officer. The second installment of Rs. 35,000/- is to be paid on 15th September, 1951. What was contracted for was the sale of forest produce, which is proprietary right vested in the proprietor in the property which according to the Act is to vest in the State. The plea that the contract was only for the sale of goods i.e. movable property and that as the trees have been marked and felled before 31st March 1951, the contract of sale of goods had been concluded cannot be accepted. The contract was clearly not for sale of goods but for transfer of right in property. [593 C-E] (b) In order that the property in the goods passes under the Sale of Goods Act, it is necessary that the tree should be felled and ascertained before the .relevant date. In the present case, the trees were not felled before 31st March, 1951 and further they were not ascertained as required under the contract for the sale as logs had to be checked and passed by State Forest staff by affixing the mark before they can be removed by the appellant. Since the trees were not felled and ascertained the title in the goods had not passed to the appellant before 31st March. 1951, the date on which the estate vested in the State. The provisions of s.
 6(1), therefore, will be attracted and this being a transfer of right in property which is liable to vest in the State after 16th March, 1950, it shall be void from the date of vesting. [584 A, G-H, 585 A] Badri Prasad v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. [1967] 2 S.C.R. 380; followed.
 3.Taking into account the fact that the appellant and the second respondent are brothers, the imminence of the vesting of the entire estate of the second respondent with the State, and the absence' of any material to show that the appellant was possessed of the funds, the appellant would not have paid the amount of Rs. 35,0001- to the second respondent. After the vesting of the forest in the Government, the Government under s. 6(2) offered to permit the appellant to remove the trees on payment of Rs.
 35,000/-. Having agreed to the condition and paid Rs.
 35,000/- the appellant cannot ask for any refund.
