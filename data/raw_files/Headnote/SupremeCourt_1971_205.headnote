 The assessee derived income from house properties and from the business of a registered partnership firm. On March 19, 1953 the assessee created a trust in respect of two houses.
 it was provided in the trust ,deed that the trustees shall pay a sum of Rs. 200/- per month to the settlor, for life for his own absolute use and benefit out of the income of the trust estate remaining after payment of taxes, rents etc. The Income-tax Officer held that the income from the aforesaid two properties was assesses able in the hands of the assessee inasmuch as he had retained a portion of the income from the trust properties for himself whereby the trust -became a revocable trust under the provisions of s.
 16(1) (c) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner upheld the view taken by the Income- tax Officer. The Tribunal however held that -only the sum of Rs. 2400/- annually payable to the assessee could be taxed in his hands. In reference the High Court decided against the assessee. In appeal to this Court by special leave, 
HELD : The effect of the third proviso to s. 16(1) (c) is that a settlement or disposition containing a provision for retransfer of a part of the income to the settlor would not render the whole income of the settlement chargeable in his hand provided the other conditions contained in the proviso are satisfied. In other words the proviso comes to the rescue of the settlor in that the portion of the income from the trust properties which are settled on a third person is to be assessed in the hands of that person and not in the hand of the settlor, if the latter does not retain any power to "deflect the same for a period exceeding six years or during the lifetime of the done". Thus the settlement as a whole will not come within the mischief of s. 16(1) (c) if the revocability relates only to a part of the income. [314 H-315 B] A significant change was made in the language with regard to revocable transfers in the Income-tax Act, 19161. Section 63(A) of that Act expressly refers to the whole or any part of the income or assets transferred. It can well be said that the necessity for expressly mentioning part of the income was felt because under the provisions of the 1922 Act part of the income was not covered. [315 C-F] There was no dispute in the present case that the trust created was a genuine one. Since it fulfilled the conditions laid down in the third proviso only that part of the income which accrued or was received by the settlor could be assessed as his income The income accruing to the other beneficiaries could not be included in the total income of the assessee.
