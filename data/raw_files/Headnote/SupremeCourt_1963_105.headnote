 The appellant is a corporation incorporated under the laws of Belguim and carries on business in Brussels. The respondent is a company registered under Indian Companies Act, 1913. On April 22, 1959, the respondent entered into an agreement with the appellant whereby the latter undertook to provide to the former technical assistance for construction works. The agreement contained an arbitration clause by which the parties agreed to refer "all disputes arising in connection with this agreement" "under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce." In 1961 the respondent instituted a suit on the Original Side of the High Court of Bombay praying for various reliefs against the appellant.
 There.upon the appellant took out a notice of motion for an order staying the proceedings in the suit persuant to s. 3 of the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937, and/or under s. 34 of the. Arbitration Act, 1940, and/or under s. 151 of the COde of Civil Procedure, 1908. The High Court refused the motion one ground that the arbitration clause of the agreement was invalid, for it obliged the appellant, contrary to s. 3.89 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956, to go to arbitration otherwise than in accordance with the Arbitration Act X of 1940.. The present appeal is by way of a certificate granted by the High Court.
 117 In the appeal it was urged that s. 389 of the Companies Act was an enabling provision and did not compel an Indian Company to agree to refer differences to arbitration only in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act. If the company desired to refer a dispute to arbitration under the Arbitration Act it might do so but the power to submit to arbitration being an incident to the power to enter into a contract for the purpose of carrying on its business, was unrestricted and that sub-s. (3) of s.
 389 applied not to consensual arbitration but only to statutory arbitration in pursuance of the companies Act, i.e. arbitration under s. 494 (b) of the Companies Act, 1956.
 Held that s. 389 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956, is intended to provide that all arbitration to which a company is a party shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act X of 1940. Section 389 (1) of the Companies Act, 1956, regulates the power of the Indian Company to agree to submit disputes to arbitration and by sub s. (3) of s. 389 the Arbitration Act applies to all arbitrations to which an Indian Company is a party.
 But s. 47 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, is as much a part of the Indian Arbitration Act as any other provision and that section makes the provisions of the Arbitration Act applicable to all arbitrations and to all proceedings thereunder but subject to the provisions of s. 46 and in so far as is otherwise provided by any law for the time being in force. By the use of the words "save in so far as is otherwise provided by any law for the time being in force the Legislature has clearly made the provisions of the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937 applicable to consensual arbitration under the Arbitration Act, 1940 when the conditions prescribed for application of that Act are attracted, even if the scheme of arbitration recognized thereby is inconsistent with ss. 3 to 38 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. Arbitration according to the provisions of the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937 being recognized by the Arbitration Act, 1940, an agreement to refer disputes in accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce is not inconsistent with s. 389 of the Companies Act, 1956.
