 The petitioner was detained by an order issued under r.
 30(1)(b) of the DefEnce of India Rules. He challenged the detention order in a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution mainly on the ground that the order enumerated six out of eight possible grounds of detention which showed that the detaining authority had not really applied its mind to the matter. The affidavit filed by the Home Minister stated that the detention order was made on his personal satisfaction that it was necessary to detain the petitioner under the Rules "with a view to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the safety of India and maintenance of public order etc." 
HELD : (i) The order of detention under r. 30(1) (b) of the Rules deprives a citizen of this country of his personal liberty and in view of the suspension of some of the fundamental rights by the President on account of the emergency, a citizen has very limited opportunity of challenging an order of detention properly passed under the Rules. Section44 of the Defence of India Act says that there should be as little interference with the ordinary avocations of life and the enjoyment of property as may be consonant with the ensuring of the public safety and interest and the Defence of India and Civil Defence. If in 'Any case it appears that the detaining authority did not apply its mind properly before making the order of detention the order in question would not be an order under the Rules and the person detained would be entitled to release. [137 F-138 C] (ii) Of the eight grounds of detention in s. 3(2)(15) of the Defence of India Act one refers to foreigners i.,e. of being of hostile origin. An Indian Citizen can thus be detained on seven possible grounds and the detention order in the present case mentioned six of them. However in the affidavit filed by the Minister only two of these grounds namely safety of India and the maintenance of public order were mentioned. In these circumstances there could be little doubt that the authority concerned did not apply its mind properly before the order in question was passed in the present case. Such a discrepancy between the grounds mentioned in the order and the grounds stated in the affidavit of the authority concerned can only show an amount of casualness in passing the order of detention against the provisions of s. 44 of the Act. [138 D-H] Casualness was also apparent from the conjunctive 'or' used in the order showing that it was more or less a copy of s.
 3(2) (15). The use of the word 'etc.' in the affidavit was another example of casualness. This casualness showed that the mind of the authority concerned was really not applied to the question of detention of the petitioner. The order of 135 detention passed without application of mind was no order under the Rules and the petitioners was entitled to release.
 [139 C] (iii) The fact that the order of detention was not written by the Minister himself but by his subordinates was irrelevant. It is the duty of the Minister to see that the order issued is in accordance with his satisfaction and carries out his directions. [139 G]
