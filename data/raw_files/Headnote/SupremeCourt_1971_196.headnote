 In 1961, the new State of Mysore enacted Mysore Land Revenue (Surcharge) Act, 1961, by which a surcharge on the land Revenue @15 n.p. on every rupee of land revenue was levied and this was payable by every landholder liable to pay a sum exceeding Rs. 20 as land revenue. By another enactment Mysore Land Revenue (Surcharge) Amendment Act, 1962, the surcharge for 1962-63 and 1963-64 was raised to 100 per cent of the land revenue in the case of wet and garden lands and 75 % in respect of dry lands.
 Both these Acts were challenged before the High Court on several grounds but the High Court rejected them and dismissed the petitions. In appeal, before this Court it was contended (i) that the Mysore Legislature was not competent to enact the Mysore Act of 1961 and the amending Act and (ii) that since there is inequality in taxation between lands comprised in South Kanara District and the areas in the erstwhile Mysore State, the levy is hit by Art.
 14 as being discrimirfatory in character and therefore bad in law. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD: (i) Surcharge fell squarely under Entry 45 of List It and it is not a tax on land revenue but an enhancement of land revenue by way of surcharge and even if it is raised by 1 00 % does not change the nature of the imposition. It is still land revenue and the Mysore Legislature is competent to enact the impugned Acts. [140 D- E] (ii) In view of the temporary nature of the Acts imposing additional land revenue, while resettlement and survey was being done in the entire State in order to have a uniform land revenue law, the Acts in question are not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution.
