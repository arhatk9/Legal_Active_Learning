 The appellant and respondent No. 1 were candidates for election as members to the Municipal Committee, Malkapur.
 Respondent No. 1 objected, at the time of scrutiny, to the candidature of the appellant on the ground that the appellant had an interest in the Municipal Committee because his son was employed by the Committee and so, he was dis- qualified from standing for election under s. 15(1) of the Central Provinces & Berar Municipalities Act, 1922. The appellant disputed the validity of the objection by saying that his son was not staying with him and had no connection with him whatsoever. The appellant and his sons were living in the same house, but each one lived in the portion allotted to him, and messed separately. Though the ration- card was in the name of the appellant for the whole family and the income shown therein as the income of the family was only that of the appellant, the earnings of the sons were not utilized for purposes of the family. The Supervising Officer overruled the objection. Thereupon, respondent No.
 1 filed a writ petition in the High Court, in which the objection was upheld. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The mere relationship of a person with an employee of the Municipal Committee does not justify the inference that such a person has interest direct or indirect in his employment under the Municipal Committee. The interest to which s. 15(1) of the Act refers cannot mean mere sentimental or friendly interest; it must mean interest which is pecuniary, or material, or of a similar nature.
 Hence the enquiry should be not whether the appellant is interested in his son but whether the appellant is interested in the employment of his son.
 In the circumstances of this case, all that was proved was the mere relationship between the appellant and his son who was the employee of the Municipal Committee. Therefore, the conclusion of the High Court, based on that relationship, was erroneous. [341 H; 342 E-F; 343 F]
