 The respondent filed an election petition challenging the validity of the election to the Haryana Vidhan Sabha from the Jhajjar Constituency held on 11-3-1973 in which the appellant was declared elected. The election petition contained elaborate details of allegations relating to votes cast in the name of dead persons, votes cast in the name of Government servants who did not cast their votes, votes cast twice or more than twice either in the same Constituency or more than one constituency, allegations of corrupt practices and also of irregularities committed during the course of the counting. Various issues were framed in respect of these allegations and were made triable by the learned single Judge of the High Court by his order dated 17-8-1972. On appeal by special leave from the order of the learned single Judge, dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The election petition in the instant case gives more particulars than would have been found by any body with any amount of experience in respect of election petitions.
 S. 83(1)(a) contemplates giving a concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies and s.
 83(1)(b) requires full particulars of corrupt practice to be furnished. To say as is done by appellant, that the petition should contain not only the material facts but also the evidence on which he relies to prove those material facts is directly contrary to the provisions of Order VI, Rule 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure, the earlier part of which is similar to clause (1) (a) of s. 83. The Code of Civil Procedure applies to all trials of election petitions and to require that a party should not only state the material facts on which he relies. which the respondent has done more than amply in this case. but also that he should state the evidence on which he relies is not a proposition which can be accepted either as correct in law or as one which justice requires. [55E, G] (ii) The charges of corrupt practices under s. 123 of the Act are quasi-criminal in nature, and should, therefore, be proved satisfactorily as it has a double consequence, the election of the returned candidate being set aside and the candidate incurring a subsequent disqualification as well.
 It could not be said in the instant case that the allegations in the election petition are vague or general in nature or lack material particulars and are as such liable to be struck down as not raising a triable issue. The procedure to be adopted for the trial would depend upon the circumstances of each case and each fact sought to be proved. it would not be feasible to lay down any hard and fast rule on this subject.
