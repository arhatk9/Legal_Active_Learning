 In 1955 the complainants protested to the appellant that he was infringing their trade-mark but no further action was taken by them at that time. In November 1960, the appellant was found in possession of labels and tobacco tins carrying marks deceptively similar to the complainants' trade mark.
 After investigation the police lodged in March 1961 a charge-sheet against the appellant in respect of alleged offences under s. 78 read' with s. 77 and P. 79 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958. The trial Magistrate convicted the appellant who was however acquitted by the Sessions Judge principally on the ground that the prosecution was barred as it was not instituted within the period prescribed by s. 92 of the Act. In appeal against the order of acquittal the High Court convicted him but granted him a certificate under Art, 134 of the Constitution.
 
HELD:The period under s. 92 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 commences to run from the date of the commission of the offences charged or from the date of discovery by the prosecutor of the offence charged. The period does not have to be reckoned from the first discovery of infringement of trade-mark by the prosecutor. In this respect s. 92 of the Act of 1958 is materially different from s. 15 of the Merchandise Marks Act 4 of 1889. [73A-D] Ruppell v. Ponnusami Tavan and Anr., I.L.R. 22 Mad 488 and Dau Dayal v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1958] INSC 120; A.I.R. 1959 S. C. 433, distinguished.
 Abdulsatar Khan Kamruddin Khan v. Ratanlal Kishenalal, I.L.R. 59 Bom. 551 and Emperior v. Chhotalal Amarchand, I.L.R. (1937) Bom. 183, referred to.
 There was nothing to substantiate the appellant's plea based on s. 77 of the Act that the complainants had acquiesced in his use of the deceptive trade-mark.
