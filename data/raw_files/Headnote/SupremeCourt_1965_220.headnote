 P, the tenant of a room, in a block of buildings owned by a trust of which the appellants were trustees, left the room without informing the appellants and leaving K in occupation thereof. The appellants never recognised K as a tenant. No rent was paid from 1st January 1956. The appellants gave the tenant P a notice to quit and thereafter filed a suit against P and K for recovery of possession of the room under the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 on three grounds, namely, sub-letting without permission, non-payment of rent and bona fide requirement the room for their own use and occupation. Evidence was led on the second and last grounds. An ex parte decree in ejectment was passed and on 30th April 1959, the appellants obtained possession. On 1st May 1959, K wrote to the Accommodation Controller that he was evicted and rendered homeless, and the Controller on September 10, 1959 passed two separate orders under the Bombay Land Requisition Act, 1948, requisitioning the room by one, and allotting the room to K by the other. The appellants moved the High Court under Art. 226 for quashing these orders but were unsuc- cessful.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended by the appellants that : (i) Since the appellants obtained an ejectment decree on the ground that they wanted the room for their own use and they did not intend to let it out at the time of requisition, the room would not be 'premises' under s. 4(3) of the Act of 1948 which could be requisitioned; and (ii) the order of requisition was passed mala fide.
 
HELD: (i) (By Full Court) : The room was 'premises' within the definition of that word in the Act of 1948 and could be requisitioned. [327 H; 338 F] Per Sarkar J : The expression "let or intended to be let separately" in the definition of premises in the Act of 1948 is only applicable to a' part of a building for there is no question of a whole building being let separately. The words "intended to be let" in this definition do not refer to any intention to let, actually existing at the time of the requisition; they have been used to indicate that a part of a building which had never been let before would not be "premises" within the Act unless the lessor had intended to let it separately. If it is proved that the landlord had at any time let or intended to let a part of a building separately, it would for all time to come be 'premises' within the Act of 1948. [326 H; 327 D, E] Per Raghubar Dayal and Ramaswami, JJ : The words 'let or intended to be let separately' can apply only to the letting of a part of building, as rightly, a landlord of a building is not to be forced to let a part of the building when he is in occupation of it. Therefore, from the date of the 323 enforcement of the Requisition Act, every building comes within the expression "premises" and a part of a building comes within the expression, if it is let or if it is intended to be let separately on that date. It would be impracticable to decide every time a part of a building fell vacant, whether the landlord intends or does not intend to let it. [337 G-H; 338 B, E] (ii) Per Raghubar Dayal and Ramaswami, JJ. : The facts that the allottee had not paid rent previously to the appellants, took various steps to delay the execution of the decree for ejectment and applied to the Accommodation Controller for allotment to himself on the day following the ejectment, do not, in law, make the requisition order mala fide, when the order was not made on account of any animus against the appellants or for a purpose for which requisition could not be made. [339 F-H] Requisitioning of premises for allotment to a person who is homeless is requisitioning for a public purpose. The allotment to a person who was a tenant of the premises and who remiss in his duties as a tenant and had been evicted in execution of a decree of a court, in pursuance of the practice that the first informant of the existence of a "suppressed vacancy" would be allotted the premises, is not against law. Moreover, the conditions of allotment of the requisitioned premises ensure that the landlord would not be put to any further trouble so far as the collection of rent is concerned. [339 H; 340 B-D] The first part of s. 13 (1) (g) of the Rent Act refers to persons who receive or are entitled to receive rents on their own account and not to persons who receive or are entitled to receive 'rents as a trustee. Such a trustee- landlord can require the premises under the section for occupation for purposes of the trust, but since the suit was uncontested, no occasion arose in the ejectment suit for the court to determine whether reasonable accommodation was available for the tenant and whether greater hardship would be caused to the landlord if no ejectment was ordered. If the Government happens to requisition the premises for the person who had been evicted therefrom in execution of a decree of a civil court, it does not mean that the Government is not respecting the decree of the court and is acting against public interest or against the interests of administration of justice. [341 A-C; 343 B-C] There is no conflict between the provisions of s. 6 of the Requisition Act and the provisions of ss. 13 and 17 of the Rent Act and the requisition was valid. [342 C] Under s. 17(1) of the Rent Act, the court may order the landlord to reallot the premises to the tenant who had been evicted in case the landlord does not occupy the premises within a period of one month, or, if the landlord reallots the premises to another person within a year of the eviction. Since the Requisition Act provides by s. 6, that the landlord cannot occupy the premises which had become vacant on the eviction of the tenant within a month of the receipt of the intimation of vacancy by the State Government, the court will not exercise its discretionary power of reallotment to the tenant when another enactment by its language provides for the landlord's non-occupation.
 Under s. 17(2), a landlord is liable to conviction if he keeps the premises unoccupied without reasonable cause or if he fails to comply with the order passed under s. 17(1).
 The non-occupation of the premises within one month of the ejection of the tenant, when s. 6(1) of the Requisition Act applies to the premises, will be non-occupation for a reasonable cause and therefore, there can be no, occasion for a conviction on the ground that the premises were kept unoccupied. [341 F-G, H; 342 A-B] 324 Further, the Requisition Act was enacted later than the Rent Act and since no exception from requisition with respect to premises becoming vacant on the eviction of a tenant on the ground of bona fide requirement by the landlord had been made, the Requisition Act would apply to such premises also.
 [342 C-E] The fields of operation of the two Acts are different.
 Under the Rent Act, the civil court in deciding a suit for eviction, simply takes into consideration the needs of the landlord vis-a-vis the tenant and the grounds of eviction.
 Under the requisition Act, the State Government, when considering the question of requisitioning the premises does not consider such matters but considers only whether the purpose for which it is to requisition is a public purpose or not. To hold that the benefit of the Act cannot be given to persons evicted on the ground that the landlord required the premises for his own use would not only deprive the evicted person from getting the premises allotted to himself but would also deprive many other homeless persons besides some special class of persons, allotments to whom would clearly come within public purpose. [342 F, G, H; 343 C-D] It is not open 'to the appellants to urge that the premises did not become vacant or were not vacant when the requisition order was passed, because, a declaration was made in the requisition order that the premises were vacant and such a declaration operates as conclusive evidence of the premises being vacant. [339 A-B] The fact that the allottee was not made a party to the proceedings, is also fatal to the maintainability of the writ petition. [343 F] Per Sarkar, J. (Dissenting) : The orders of requisition and allotment passed in this case were not within the contemplation of the Act. In the circumstances of the case it has to 'be held that the ejectment decree was passed on the ground mentioned in s. 13(1)(g) of the Act of 1947, that is to say, the court ordering ejectment found that the appellants required the room for their own occupation and they were entititled to it in preference to the defendants P and K. The result of the orders under the Act of 1948 was to annul the decision of the court granting the ejectment. It cannot be said that the powers under the Act of 1948 were intended to be exercised to set at naught the judgment of a court. [329 A-B, D] If the powers to requisition and allot under the Act of 1948 could be exercised in a case where an ejectment decree had been passed under s. 13(1)(g) of the Act of 1947, a conflict would arise between s. 17 of the Act of 1947 and s.
 6 of the Act of 1948. This conflict has to be harmonised and the only way to do so is to say that the Requisition Act does, not apply to, a case where the landlord has been permitted to recover possession for his own occupation. [330 H; 331 A-B] The Act of 1948 does not contemplate a requisition in vacuo;
 there must be a prospective or actually homeless person in view before an order requisition can be passed. [331 H] The Act of 1948 does not give larger powers of requisition where the landlord has failed to give notice of a vacancy as required by s. 6 of that Act. [332 D-E]
