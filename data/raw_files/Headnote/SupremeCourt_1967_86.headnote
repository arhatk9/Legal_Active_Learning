 The assessee claimed exemption from tax under s. 14-B of the Incometax Act, 1922 for a sum donated to a Trust, whose most of the objects were charitable and religious in nature, but one was not, and it was open to the trustees to utilise the income of any one of the objects to the exclusion of all other objects. The Revenue rejected the claim for exemption , but the Appellate Tribunal allowed it as it had in relation to the previous assessment year held that the Trust was a public trust.On reference, the High Court answered the question against the assessee.In appeal to this Court, the assessee contended that (i) this particularobject must not be read isolated from the other object.-, of the trust but having regard to the immediately preceding object which was to run hospitals and dispensaries, the impugned object, viz., the manufacture of pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations must be deemed to be for the purpose of carrying out the earlier object, and (ii) the High Court acted in excess of jurisdiction in raising a new question which was not raised by the Appellate Tribunal, namely, whether the trust itself was constituted for wholly religious or charitable purposes within the meaning of s. 4 (3) (i) of the Act.
 HELD :-The appeal must fail.
 (i)There was no connection between the two objects of the trust and upon an interpretation of the document as a whole, it could not be said that the earlier object was the dominant object of the trust and the latter was a subsidiary object. In view of the absolute power of selection ,ranted to the trustees to select between charitable and non- charitable objects, the provision of s. 4 (3) (i) of the Act could not be ipplied to the Trust and no exemption could be granted to the assessce under s. of the; Act.

 (i)The High Court was within its jurisdiction in examining the question whether the Trust was eligible for exemption from income-tax under s. 4(3) (i) of the Act. Even where a question of law was not raised before the Tribunal but the Tribunal deals with it, it must be deemed to be one arising out of its order. [364B-D] Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v.
