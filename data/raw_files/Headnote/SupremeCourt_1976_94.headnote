 The accused-respondents were acquitted by the High Court of capital offences. This Court granted the State of U.P. special leave to appeal, and under Art. 136 read with Art. 142, issued orders directing the re-arrest and detention of the accused. The orders were challenged by the accused - respondents on the grounds that their acquittal and the findings on which it is based remain fully in force during the pendency of the State appeal, and that in the absence of a specific statutory provision, the Supreme Court's inherent power under the Cr.P.C., or under Art. 142, cannot be invoked to order the deprivation of the acquitted pension's liberty, and that such an order word violate Articles 14 19(1)(a) to (6) and 21 of the Constitution.
 On a reference of this question to the Constitution Bench, ^ 
 HELD: This Court, while granting special leave to appeal against an order of acquittal on a capital charge, is competent by virtue of Art. 142 read with Art. 136, to exercise the same powers which the High Court has under sec.
 427 (re-enacted as Sec. 390 of the new Cr.P.C. Of 1973). An order directing the re-arrest and detention of an accused- respondent who has been acquitted by the High Court of a capital offence, neither offends Art. 21 or any other fundamental right guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution. nor deprives the accused-respondent of his liberty in a manner otherwise than in accordance with procedure established by law.
