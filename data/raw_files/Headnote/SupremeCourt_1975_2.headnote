 The nine petitioners before the High Court were selected for the post of computers and were empanelled. After a few months the panel was cancelled. In a writ petition under art. 2 of the Constitution the petitioners contended that there were no procedural irregularities or defects in the selection and as such the cancellation of the penal, was improper. The High Court held that since there were only four vacancies only five persons could be selected forthe panel after taking into account 25 per cent unforeseen vacanciesand rejected the contention of the petitioners that work-charged shortterm vacancies should also have been taken into account.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : The High Court was right in holding that work-charged short term vacancies were not such as should be said to arise due to normal wastage during the currency of the panel. Vacancies arising due to normal wastage during the currency of a panel are such as could generally be foreseen because they occur on account of retirement of those at present holding the posts or for other similar cause. A short term vacancy for a work-charged job cannot tic said to arise due to normal wastage. [159C]
