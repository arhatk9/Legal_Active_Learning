 Shri Mukherjee was a Motion-setter employed by the appellants. His post was abolished and he was given the job of a trainee on probation for the post of Assistant Line- Fixer (Assistant Grade 1). The management found him unsuit- able for the job even after extending his probation period upto nine months, and offered him the post of a fitter on the same pay which he had received as a Motion-setter. The letter stated that unless he accepted the offer within two days of receiving it, his rejection of the same would be presumed and he could then be retrenched. Shri Mukherjee wrote to the management to give him another chance to show his efficiency in his job, but instead of replying to him, the management struck off his name from the rolls, without complying with the provisions of s. 25F(a) and (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act. A dispute between the parties led to a reference to the Labour Court which resulted in an award in favour of Shri Mukherjee. The management's writ petition was rejected first by the Single Judge and then by the Division Bench of the High Court in appeal.
 Dismissing the appeal by Certificate, the Court, 
HELD :(1) Merely questioning the vires of s. 2-A in the writ application does not dispense with the requirement of stating facts in order to support the legal ground. If the ground was taken by making the appropriate allegation that the dispute relating to the termination of service of the workman was not espoused by the union, it would have been necessary for the Labour Court to call for a report from the Administration, and it would have been possible for the workman to show that his case was, in fact, espoused by a substantial number of workmen or by a Union. [594 B-C] (2)No order, even under s. 27(c) of the Standing Orders can be passed against the workman who is not absent for "more than eight consecutive days." Striking off his name from the rolls by the management, is termination of his service and such termination of service is retrenchment within the meaning of s. 2(00) of the Act. Any order of retrenchment, in violation of the mandatory provisions of s.
 25F(a), the proviso apart, and (b), is invalid. [595 H, 596 A.G-D] (3)The law has been laid down by this Court holding that s. 10 of the Act does not violate Art. 14 of the Constitution. [595 E] Niemla Textile Finishing Mills Ltd. v. The 2nd Punjab Industrial Tribunal [1957] INSC 1; [1957] SCR 335, applied.
