 The members of the Burmah Shell Management Staff Association, designated as junior management staff raised an industrial dispute. The Government referred the dispute to the Industrial Tribunal. The reference was confined to the members of he junior management staff working in the Maharashtra region. At the time of reference the lowest basic salary drawn by a member of the Association was Rs.
 535/-. On behalf of the company a preliminary objection was raised that none of the members of the association was a workman. The Tribunal gave an interim award. The members of the association were classified into various categories.
 Out of these, members of six categories were held to be workmen, namely (1) Transport Engineer (2) District Engineers (3) Foreman (Chemicals), (4)- Fueling Superintendents (5) Chemists and (6) Sales Engineering Representatives. Members belonging to four categories were held not to be workmen, namely, (1) Blending Supervisors (2) Foremen (3)Depot Superintendents and (4) District Sales Representatives. The Company challenged the decision of' the, Tribunal in respect of the six categories held to be workmen and the Association challenged the decision in respect of the four categories held not to be workmen. The Association contended that whenever a technical man was employed in an industry it had to be held he was employed to do technical work respective of the manner in which and the occasions on which the technical knowledge of that person was actually brought into use and to hold otherwise would result in making the word 'technical' redundant in the definition of workman' in section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 as amended by Act 36 of 1956.
 
HELD : Of the members of six categories held to be workmen (1) Transport Engineer (2) District Engineer (3) Foreman (chemicals) and (4) Sales Engineering Representative must be held not to be workmen; and of the members of four categories held not to be workmen, the tribunal erred with respect to Blending Supervisors working in the Wadilube plant.
 A workman must be held to be employed to do that work which is the main work he is required to do, even though he may be incidentally doing other types of work. Therefore, in determining which of the employees in the various categories are covered by the definition of 'workman, one has to see what is the main or substantial work which they are employed to do.

 (i)The major part of the work done by a Transport Engineer is that of supervision of the work of repair, maintenance, servicing and fabrication which is actually carried on by mechanics, fitters and other skilled or unskilled-workmen working under him. Even if the Transport Engineer uses his technical knowledge it is used primarily for the purpose of supervislying the work done by the skilled manual labourers.
 If a person is merely employed in supervising the work of others the fact that for the purpose of proper supervision he is required to have technical knowledge Till not convert his supervisory work into technical work; the work of giving advice and guidance cannot be held to be, an employment to do technical work.
 (ii)The principal work for which a District Engineer is employed is to supervise work done by others instead of doing the work himself. His duties consist of assessing suitability of sites for depots from the point of view of technical and-engineering aspects, suggesting lay-out for constructing depots or service stations, seeing that the estimates prepared by the draughtsman are correct from the technical point of view, scrutinising tenders for construction, checking the' construction work given to the contractor, certifying bills submitted by contractors for the work done by them and preparing estimates for maintenance in respect of depots. Even though he has to use his technical knowledge for the purpose of property carrying on supervision, it cannot be held that a District Engineer is employed to do technical work.
 (iii)The duties which are performed by Foreman (Chemicals) are primarily and substantially those of a supervisory nature. His own manual work is only incidental and forms I a small part of his duties. in dealing with this case, the Tribunal erred in taking into account the duties of chemists.
 (iv) The main and substantial work which a Fuelling Superintendent does is not that of supervising the work dose by the few workmen who assist him, but is his own manual work which he carries out at the depot as well as when delivering oil to the aircraft. The fact that a Fuelling Superintendent is a leader of the team which carries out the work of fuelling cannot convert his work into that of a supervisory,nature. The tribunal was, therefore, correct in holding that a Fuelling Superintendent was a workman.
 (v) The Chemists, no doubt, ensure that the workman assisting them do their work Properly; but that small amount of supervision is only incidental to their own technical work of 'testing and giving the results of the tests to the company. the guidance and direction to the laboratory attendant and analysts is only ancillary to 'the main work, which is done by the Chemists themselves. The Chemists have therefore been rightly held to be workmen.
 (vi) The main work performed by the Sales Engineering Representative is promotion of sales which are canvassed primarily by District Sales Representative. This the Sales Engineering Representative does by giving technical advice, holding demonstrations and suggesting methods for making best use of the products sold He is not employed on clerical or manual work and the amount of technical work be does is all ancillary to his chief duty of promoting sales and giving advice.
 760 (vii)The Blending Supervisor who works in the Wadilube plant is a person employed on manual work and have to be held to be workman. His 'supervisory work is a very minor part of his duties. The major part of his duties consists in himself operating various parts of the machinery and ensuring that oils are blended properly. The decision of the Tribunal in respect of such blending supervisor is therefore, incorrect.
 (a) The principal work of another set of Blending Supervisors who are employed at a stage where the blending of oils has already been completed and the oils have been transferred to the settling tanks is that of seeing that the barrels and other containers are properly filled up by the larger number of Workmen placed under their charge who actually carry out the physical work for that purpose.
 Their duties are thus, primarily supervisory, and the tribunal's decision that Blending Supervisors doing the work of this nature are not workmen is correct.
 (b) the work done by the third type of blending supervisors described as supervisors (Small Packages Filling) is primarily supervisory and consequently the decision of the Tribunal in respect of them is also correct.
 (viii)Of the three types of duties performed by the Foreman (Tank Farm and Pump House), viz., Technical, skilled mannual and supervisory, his supervisory duties are the main and substantial part of his work while other duties are only incidental. The Tribunal was, therefore, right in holding these Foremen not to be workmen.
 (ix)The other class of Foreman (Tank Lorry Loading Tank Wagon Loading and Tank Wagon Unloading) are no doubt responsible for proper loading and unloading; but this 'duty is discharged by supervising the work of manual labourers who actually perform the work of loading and unloading. The Tribunal's decision therefore, that these Foremen are not workmen is correct.
 (x) On the facts found by the tribunal it is clear that the principal duties of Depot Superintendents are of supervising and managerial while the clerical duties are only incidental. Consequently the decision given by the Tribunal that Depot Superintendents are employed on managerial or supervisory work and are not workmen is correct.

 228 (L.A.T.), referred to.
 (xi) The case of District Sales Representative is clearly that of a person who cannot fall within any of the four classes mentioned in S. 2(s) because his work cannot be held to be either manual, clerical, technical or supervisory.
 The work 'of investigating and promoting sales cannot be included in any of these four classifications. He is, therefore, not a workman.
