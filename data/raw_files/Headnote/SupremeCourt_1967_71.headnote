 The predecessor of the appellant Railway entered into an agreement in November, 1933, with the respondent company, which bad a large sugar mill, for the construction of two "assisted sidings" to facilitate the movement of goods traffic to and from the sugar mill. Under the agreement, part of the expenditure was met by the company and it was provided that the company would pay an annual contribution to the Railways for the use of the Railway portion of the siding and in lieu of paying separately the interest and maintenance cost of the siding. It was further provided that in the event of the contribution not being sufficient to meet the cost of the working of the siding, the Railway was entitled, on giving six months' notice, to modify the contribution and charge the company such higher amount as it may consider necessary. By virtue of another arrangement between the Railway and the Company, at the company's request, the Railway would arrange for the shunting of wagons from the Company's factory yard to the Railway lines and for doing so, the Railway would charge the company -a shunting engine charge calculated at a fixed rate per hour.
 'In February 1958, the Railway gave notice of increased charges to be paid instead of the fixed contribution. It also demanded an increased shunting engine charge. The company thereupon filed a complaint under s. 41( 1) (c) of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 before the Railway Rate,-.
 Tribunal at Madras, claiming that the charges claimed by the Railway were unreasonable and requesting the Tribunal to fix reasonable charges in exercise of its powers under s. 41(3) of the Act. The complaint was contested by the Railway on the grounds (i) that the charges to which the complaint related were in respect of services that the Railway was not under any statutory duty to render to the company and was rendering them under private agreement with the company;
 consequently, such charges did not fall within the expression any other charge' in s. 41 (1) (c) and therefore no complaint could be filed under s. 41 challenging them on the ground of being unreasonable; (ii) that the burden of proving the charges were unreasonable was on the company which had not been discharged and the Tribunal was not competent to call upon the Railway to prove the reasonableness of the charges and to -reduce the charges only on the ground that the Railway had failed to establish their reasonableness; and (iii) that the charges demanded by the Railway were 220 in fact reasonable and should not be reduced. The Tribunal rejected the Appellants' contentions and revised the charges on the basis of the evidence adduced before it. On appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) The charges in question were covered by the expression "any other charges" in s. 41 (1) (c) and the complaint in the present case 'was rightly entertained by the Tribunal.
 The only charges which could be said to relate to the discharge by the Railway of its statutory duties would be those fixed under s. 29(1) of the Act in respect of a commodity carried by the Railway over its own lines. It is clear that a complaint under s. 41(1)(b) 'relates to fixa- tion of a rate relating to charges mentioned in s.29(1), while s. 41(1)(c) relates to a complaint in respect of any other charges mentioned in s. 29(2). The expression "any other charge" used in ss. 29(2) and 41(1)(c) cannot be given the narrow meaning of covering a charge in respect of the statutory duty of the Railway so as to exclude charges made or levied for all other services. It must necessarily cover charges which are not included in s. 29(1 ) and s. 41 (1 ) (b). It was immaterial that the charges being levied by the Railway arose only as a result of a voluntary agreement which the Railway, at its option, might have refused -to enter into. [226H; 227B, E-F] Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd Edn,. Vol. 27, Paras 434 and 436 at p. 196; referred to.
 (ii) The figures of the proposed increase in charges given on behalf of the company,, which were challenged in the complaint, did prima facie indicate that the rates fixed and demanded were unreasonable. It could not therefore be held that the Tribunal committed any error in going into the evidence given on behalf of the Railway and arriving at reasonable rates after a full consideration of that evidence and the evidence tendered on behalf of the company. [229E, F-G] (iii) It was necessary to include a margin of profit in the "shunting engine charge" fixed by the Tribunal and (upon an examination of the evidence to revise the siding charges.
 the Court therefore itself fixed the rates for the charges to be levied by the Railway.
