 The appellant was convicted of murder by the Sessions Judge mainly on the evidence of the approver. The High Court, in appeal did not consider it safe to rely on a part of the approver's evidence which related to an earlier incident but found that his main story was reliable as well as corroborated by other evidence. The conviction of the appellant was upheld. In appeal before this Court by special leave, the appellant contended that the double test for the approver's evidence laid down in Sarwan Singh's case had not been correctly applied by the courts below.
 
HELD : The first test laid down in Sarwan Singh's case is that the approver's evidence must show that he is a reliable witness, and that is a test which is common to all witnesses. The test obviously means that the court should find that there is nothing inherently improbable in the evidence given by the approver and that there is no finding that the approver had given false evidence. The second test which thereafter still remains to be applied in the case of an approver, and which is not always necessary when judging the evidence of other witnesses, is that his evidence must receive sufficient corroboration. [247 H] In the present case the High Court had held that the evidence of The approver was reliable and was corroborated on material particulars by good prosecution witnesses who had been believed by the Court. There was therefore no error in the judgment of the High Court in upholding the conviction of the appellant. The fact that the High Court did not accept the evidence of the approver relating to the earlier incident did not mean that the Court hold the approver to be an unreliable or untruthful witness. What it did was to act on the principle of valuing the evidence of the approver with caution and not accepting it unless it was corroborated at least in some material particulars.
