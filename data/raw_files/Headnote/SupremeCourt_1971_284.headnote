 The appellant declared himself surety in the court of a Sub- Divisional Magistrate and bound himself to produce a truck "whenever ordered by the court" to produce. the same. He was given notice to produce the truck by another Sub- Divisional Magistrate in the same district and when he failed to produce the same the Magistrate passed an order forfeiting the surety bond and directing the realisation of the amount covered by the bond as fine. In his revision application before the High Court the appellant took a plea that the bond could be forfeited only by the court in which it was executed. The High Court did not allow the plea to be raised on the ground that the plea was not raised either before the Magistrate or before the Sessions Judge.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The High Court rightly refused the appellant permission to urge the ground as to want of jurisdiction.
 Such a plea of jurisdiction is interlaced with questions of fact. It may be that the case was transferred, or that a particular court was abolished, or that allocation of busi- ness was changed or redistributed. The records indicate many probabilities and that was why the High Court declined to go into the question. [1087 B] (2) Even if the appellant were permitted to raise this question in the present case without any question of fact and purely on the construction of the bond, it would appear that the appellant bound himself to produce the truck whenever ordered by the court to produce the same. There was no undertaking to produce the truck in a particular court. The undertaking was to the court of the Magistrate and the Magistrate exercises jurisdiction in the whole district under s. 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The word 'court' in the bond in the present case means the Magistrate's court which dealt with the case. Furthermore, the bond provided that in case of default the appellant bound himself to forfeit to the Government the amount covered by the bond. [1088 C] Ballabhdas Motiram Gupta v. Emperor, A.I.R. 1943 Bom. 178, held inapplicable.
