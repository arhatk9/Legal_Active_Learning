 The respondents field a suit against appellant No. 1 for permanent injunction restraining him from interfering with the Guru Garanth Saheb, for religious recitals in the Darbar Saheb as well as restraining him from interfering with the rights of reciting the Guru Garanth Sahib and holding and joining the religious congregations and Satsang in the Gurudwara. The villagers dedicated certain land to the Granth Saheb in the year 1897. Several persons succeeded as the trustees, the appellant being the last one at the relevant time. The grievance made in the suit was that the appellant was committing a breach of trust by not using the Dera in general and Darbar Saheb in particular for the purposes for which the same was dedicated. The Trial Court held that the suit was not maintainable in the absence of the consent of the Advocate General as required by section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code. The First Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the Trial Court. The Single Judge of the High Court in Regular Second Appeal dismissed the plaintiff's appeal on the ground that the suit was hit by section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code. On grant of leave under clause 10 of the Letters Patent. Bench allowed the appeal and remitted back the case to the Trial Court holding that the suit was not barred by section 92 of the Code.
 On appeal by Special Leave it was contended before this Court that (1) The judgment of the High Court in relation to section 92 of the Code is erroneous in law. The suit was barred under the said provision of the Code; (2) On the death of one of the plaintiffs appellants during the pendency of the second appeal in the High Court the whole of the appeal abated and ought to have been dismissed as such.
 Allowing the appeal.
 
HELD : Since the suit has been filed in a representative capacity on the death of one of the plaintiffs it did not abate. The decision in Raja Anand Rao followed. [53C] 
HELD FURTHER : The plaint alleges breach of duty on the part of the trustee and the plaintiffs seek the court's aid against the trustee for forcing him to discharge his obligations by due performance of his duties. The present suit was a suit for a decree under section 92 of the Code and since it was not filed in conformity with the requirements of that provision of law it was not maintainable. It is well settled that the maintainability of the suit under section 92 of the Code depends upon the allegations in the plaint and does not fall for decision with reference to the averments in the written statement.
 The plaintiffs in their plaint did not in terms ask for the one or the other reliefs mentioned in section 92(1). They, however, alleged acts of breach of trust, mismanagement, undue interference, with the right of the public in the worship of Granth Saheb. They wanted a decree of the court against the appellants to force him to carry out the objects of the trust and to perform his duties as a trustee. [57A-B] ARGUMENTS For the Appellants : On reading the entire plaint the reliefs claimed are covered by s. 92(1)(a) to (h) Code of Civil Procedure.
 (i)The plaint clearly shows that the property involved is trust property and that the trust is a public trust or charitable and religious nature.
 49 (ii)The plaint also shows that the aim was for benefit of the public.
 (iii) Reliefs claimed fall within Sub-Clause (e)-The place where Guru Granth Sahib was placed was called "Darbar Sahib" where it was to be recited and where Sat Sang and Amrit Pan Ceremony were to be held. The reach alleged is that the appellant is not using the "Darbar Sahib,, for the purpose for which it 'was dedicated and further says that the villagers have a right to recite and worship Granth Sahib installed in the Dera in general and Darbar Sahib in particular and that the appellant has stopped the villagers from doing so. Relief claimed is that the Defendants should be restrained from interfering with the maintaining of Granth Sahib for religious recitations in the Darbar Sahib in the Dharamsala or Dera.
 Therefore, the respondents required directions of the court to demarcate the exact location of Darbar Sahib within the Dera Jaimal Singh where Granth Sahib is to be located and worshipped etc.
 Such a suit relates to the administration of the said trust and falls within subclause (e) of s. 92(1).
 Further the directions required involve framing of a scheme for time for worshipping the Granth Sahib or for its recitation and for holding Sat Sang and Amrit Pan Ceremony.
 Therefore, the suit falls within s. 92(1)(g).
 In any case the suit falls within Sub-clause (h).-The defendants contention is that the scope of s. 92(1)(a) to (h) should involve administration of the Trust Property.
 Sub-Clause (a) to (g) describe some of the administrative problems arising in a particular case as all such problems could not be easily stated in a statutory provision. Any suit filed to establish existence of a trust or to establish title of the trust to a piece of property would not be covered by any sub-clause of s. 92.
 The plaintiffs did not contest that the suit was not covered by clause (h) before the First Appeal Court, and also vide Judgment of the High Court. In substance the complaint is that the appellant contrary to purpose of the Trust is pre- venting the villagers etc, from worshipping and reciting Granth Sahib in the Darbar Sahib and is preventing them access there to hold Sat Sang and other ceremonies. These breaches are obviously in the course of the administration of the Trust. and must be held to be covered by sub-clause (h).
 Some of the plaintiffs have died during the pendency of the Second Appeal in the High Court and their legal representatives were not brought on the record. Therefore, the appeal had abated against them. Defendants had argued that the appeal had abated in toto but this plea was rejected by the Single Judge. The defendant-, filed cross objection against this decision before the Letters Patent Bench but the same were dismissed without discussion.
 If it be held that the suit was filed for public benefit in a representative capacity then this point is conceded to have no force. However, if it be held that the suit was to enforce individual rights then the appeal had abated in toto as otherwise there will be conflicting decisions whether a suit is covered by s. 92 or not.
 Under s. 5 of the Punjab Common Lands (Regulation) Act 18 of 1961 all Shamlat Lands vest in the village Panchayat. The land in dispute is Shamlat land, therefore, the plaintiffs or villagers could not file a suit relating to this Shamlat land. Plaintiffs case is that under s. 2(g) (ix) this land is used as a place of worship and, therefore, is not covered by this Act. The defendants case is that the present institution is not a place of worship as Radha Swamis do not carry on worship at all at any place.
 For the respondents : The substance of the plaint is (1) (a) that the defendant is not using the Dera in general and Darbar Sahib in particular for the purpose for which the same are dedicated. (b) that the defendant alleges that "maintenance of the Guru Granth Sahib and Darbar Sahib and access of the people to Dera and Darbar Sahib" depends on his sweet will and discretion. (c) that the defendant has a right not to allow any person to enter Dera and recite -L379Sup CI/75 50 Granth Sahib. (d) that the plaintiffs have a right to worship in Dera and Dar bar Sahib and recite Granth Sahib.
 (e) that the plaintiffs have a right to set that Dharmsala Dera and Gurdwara is used for the purpose and fulfilment of which the same is established. (2) In the plaint thus the existence of a trust and its denial by the defendant not only by not using it for the purpose of dedication but also openly asserting a hostile right that it is his sweet will to permit even access to the Dera are alleged. Thus the allegation in substance and form is that the existence of trust and reciting Granth Sahib is denied by defendant and he places obstruction to the free access of the beneficiaries of trust.
 (3)The relief claimed is for injunction to restrain the defendant from interfering with maintenance of Guru Granth Sahib in Darbar Sahib and from reciting the same; which it is submitted is not covered by any of the sub clauses of s.
 92(1) C.P.C. and therefore s. 92 C.P.C. is not attracted.
 (4)That since the said relief could not be covered by any other sub-clause an attempt was made by the appellant to bring the relief under sub-clause (h) of s. 92(i) which read as under "granting such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require." This clause as held by Privy Council in 1928 PC. 16 must be read not in isolation from but ejusdem generis to the other clauses of the sub-section. It is intended to cover up such other reliefs that may be necessary in order to effectively grant any one of the reliefs mentioned therein the earlier clauses something ancillary or akin to them or some relief which follows as a necessary corallary flowing therefrom.
 It cannot be construed to mean some such relief which in its nature and substance something wholly different from them and not covered by any of the earlier sub clause (a) to (g).
 It if were so then it would cover all the various reliefs that can conceivably be claimed in a suit based on the allegation of breach of trust. That could not be the intention of the legislature otherwise nothing would be easier for the legislature to say that for the grant of any relief based on the allegations of breach of trust the sanction of advocate General would be a precondition for the institution of such a suit.
 The intention appears to be clear that in suits based on allegations of breaches of trust of charitable and religious nature where some. what may be termed drastic reliefs as contemplated in sub-clause (a) to (g) of s. 92 (1) C.P.C. are prayed then in only such cases would the sanction be needed.
 Thus suits for declaration of trust are out side the purview of s. 92, so also sents for declaration and possession. On principle there is no difference in relief of injunction from that of declaration. In fact relief of injunction has been held to be not covered among the relief contemplated in sub-clauses (a) to (h).
 5.A distinction was sought to be made between suits where allegations of total denial by defendant of existence of trust are made in a plaint from suits where breaches by defendant of trust or duties only are alleged and it was suggested that for the former suits no sanction needed and for the latter sanction was necessary.
 The said contention is not enable; firstly the denial of the existence of trust is also a breach of trust. and secondly nothing would be easier to circumvent the said condition by alleging denial by the defendant of the trust in the plaint and thereafter seeking reliefs which admittedly fall within sub clauses (a) to (g) of s. 92(1). To put it conversely and can it be suggested that where the allegations are that defendant is denying the trust but relief prayed for is removing the trustee which is clearly covered by sub clause (a), no sanction would be needed.
 It is submitted that the emphasis in section 92 C.P.C. is not on the manner in which breach of trust is alleged whether it is by denial of existence of trust or which admitting the existence of trust or while admitting the existence of trust the defendant does not perform his duties but the emphasis is on the reliefs sough for purposes of sanction.
 51 6.It is further submitted that though allegation in plaint are primarily to be looked at for this purpose but where parties have led evidence reference to the same have also been made to find out the real nature of the suit. (see 1974 Vol. 2, S.C.C. Part X 695).
 In the present case defendant in his written statement has denied the existence of trust for reciting Granth Sahib.
