 The Class II and Class 1I1 staff of the Reserve Bank of India through their Association, and Class IV staff through their Union raised an industrial dispute with the Bank which works referred by the Central Government on March 21, 1960, to the National Tribunal. The items referred bore upon scales of pay, allowances, and sundry matters connected with the conditions of service of the three classes, the most important ones being the demand of Class II staff for a scale commencing with Rs. 500 and the demand of other workmen for a need-based minimum wage as recommended by the Tripartite Conference. of 1957. In its award the Tribunal pointed out that Class I1 staff worked in a supervisory capacity and its demand for a minimum salary of Rs. 500, if conceded, would take the said staff out of the category of 'workman' as defined in s. 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Such an award, and any award carrying wages beyond Rs. 500 at any stage, the Tribunal said, was beyond its' jurisdiction to make. It went on to hold that other workmen could not raise a dispute which would involve consideration of matters in relation 'to non-workmen and that it would be even beyond the jurisdiction of the Central Government to refer such a dispute under the Industrial Disputes Act. The Tribunal therefore made no award in regard to the supervisory staff in Class II. As for the demand for a need-based minimum wage, the Tribunal held that the Tripartite resolution had not been accepted by the Government and was not binding; that a need-based minimum wage was an ideal incapable of present achievement; that as against the demand of a formula of 3 consumption units per family it was possible to allow only 2.25 units; and that the coefficient for white-collar workers would not be changed from 80 to 120 as demanded. The Tribunal's award was given on September 8, 1962 but made operative from January 1, 1962. Dissatisfied with the award, the workmen appealed by special leave, to this Court. Subsequently by resolution dated April 24, 1963 the Reserve Bank raised the minimum total emoluments, as envisaged by the definition of wages, of each and every member of the Class II staff, above Rs. 500 with effect from the dale of operation of the award.
 In their appeal before this Court it was urged on behalf of the appellants that there was a difference between 'supervisory capacity' mentioned in el. (iv) of s. 2(s) and 'supervisory work' mentioned in the main part of the section, and as Class II officers did not work in a 'supervisory capacity' they were 'workmen' under the definition. 'Supervisory Capacity it was urged, arose only when the employee was an agent of the employer.
 26 it was also urged that Class 11 workmen only had clerical and checking duties which were not supervisory in character.
 Alternatively it was contended that as Class II was filled by promotion from Class III the question as to the emoluments of the former could and should have been gone into by the Tribunal in view of the principle enunciated in the Dimakuchi Tea Estate case.
 
HELD : (i) (a) The amendment to s. 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes .Act in 1956 introduced among the categories of persons already mentioned as 'workmen' persons employed to do supervisory and technical work. So far the language of the earlier enactment was used. When, however, exceptions were engrafted, that language was departed from in cl. (iv) partly because the draftsmen followed the language of cl.
 (iii) and partly because from persons employed on supervision work some are to be excluded because they draw wages exceeding Rs. 500 per month and some because they function mainly in a managerial capacity or have duties of the same character. But the unity between the opening part of the definition and ci. (iv) was expressly preserved by using the word 'such' twice in the opening part. The words, which bind the two parts, are not-"but does not include any person. They am-"but does not include any such person" showing clearly that is being excluded is a person who answers the description "employed to do supervisory work" and he is to be excluded because being employed in a 'supervisory capacity' he draws wages exceeding Rs. 500 per month or exercises functions of a particular character. [42 B-E] Like the Taft-Hartley Act in the United states the Amending Act ,of 1956 in our country was passed to equalise bargaining power and also to give the power of bargaining and invoking the Industrial Disputes Act to supervisory workmen, but it gave it only to some of the workmen employed on supervisory work. Workman' here includes an employee employed as supervisor. There are only two circumstances in which such a person ceases to be a workman. Such a person is not a workmen if he draws wages in excess of Rs. 500 per month or if he performs managerial functions by reason of a power vested in him or by the nature of duties attached to his office. The person who ceases to be a workman is not a person who doe,-, not answer the description "employed to do supervisory work" but one who does answer that description.
 He goes out of the category of "workmen" on proof of the circumstances excluding him from the category. [42 F-H] Packard Motor Co. v. The National Labour Relations Board, [1947] USSC 48; 91 L.ed. 1040, referred to.
 (b)The National Tribunal was not justified in holding that if it I future time an incumbent would draw wage in the time scale in excess of Rs. 500, the matter must be taken to be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Central Government to make a reference in respect of him and the National Tribunal to be ousted of the jurisdiction to decide the dispute if referred. Supervisory staff drawing legs than Rs. 500 per month cannot be debarred from claiming that they should dram, more than Rs. 500 presently or it some future stage in their service. can only be deprived of the benefits if they are non-workmen at the time they seek the protection of Industrial Disputes Act. [43 C-D] (c) The word 'supervise' and its derivatives are not words of import and must often he construed in the light of the context, for unless controlled the- cover simple oversight and direction of manual work of others. It is, therefore necessary to sea the full context in which the words occur and the words of our own Act are, the surest guide. Viewed in this manner one should not overlook the import of-. the word "such" 27 which expressly links the exception to the main part.
 Unless this was done it would have been possible to argue that cl. (iv) indicated something, which, though no included in the main part, ought not by construction to be so included. By keeping the link it is clear that what is excluded is something which is already a part of the main provision. [43 F-G] (d)In s. 2(k) the word 'person' has not been limited to 'workmen' as such and must, therefore, receive a more general meaning. But it does not mean any person unconnected with the disputants in relation to -whom the dispute is not of the kind described. It could not have been intended that although the dispute does not concern them in the least, workmen are entitled to fight it out on behalf of non-workmen. [44 D-E] Dimakuchi Tea Estate's case, [1958]2 L.L.J. 500 referred to.
 If the dispute is regarding employment, non-employment, terms of employment or conditions of labour of non-workmen in which workmen are themselves vitally interested, the workmen may be able to raise an industrial dispute. Workmen can, for example, raise a dispute that a class of employees not within the definition of 'workmen' should be recruited by promotion from workmen. When they do so the workmen raise a dispute about the terms of their own employment though incidentally the terms of employment of those who, are not workmen is involved. But workmen cannot take up a dispute in respect of a class of employees who are not workmen and in whose terms of employment those workmen have no direct interest of their own. What direct interest suffices is a question of fact but it must be a real and positive interest and not fanciful or remote. [441-1] In the present case the National Tribunal was in error in not considering the claims of Class 11 emmployee whether at the instance of member. drawing less than Rs. 500 as wages or at the instance of those lower down in the scale of employment. The National Tribunal was also in error in thinking that scales of wages in excess of Rs. 500 per month at any stage were not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or that Government could not make a reference- in such a contingency. [45 C-D] (e)Duties such as distribution of work, detection of faults reporting for penalty, making arrangements for filling vacancies are supervisory. Class 11 staff performing such duties could not be said to perform only clerical or checking duties. [46 D-E] Ford Motor Company of India v. Ford Motors Staff Union, [1953] 2 L.L.J. 444 and Lloyd Bank Ltd. v. Pannalal Gupta, [1961]1 L.L.J. 18, referred to.
 (ii)(a) Minimum wages is the lowest wage in the scale below which the efficiency of the worker is likely to be impaired.
 It allows for living at a standard considered socially, medically, and ethically to be the acceptable minimum. [47 C-D] Fair wage by comparison is more generous and involves a rate sufficiently high to provide a standard family with food, shelter, clothing, medical care and education of children appropriate to the workers station in life but not at a rate exceeding the wage earning capacity of the class of establishment concerned. [47F] The living wage concept is one or more steps higher then air wage. It has now been generally accepted that living wage means that every male earner should be able to provide for his family not only the essentials but a fair measure of frugal comfort and an ability to provide for old age or evil days. [48A] CI/65-3 28 It may be taken that our politicd aim is 'living wage' though in actual practice living wage has been an ideal which has eluded our efforts like an ever-receding horizon and will so remain for sometime to come. Our general wage structure has at best reached the lower levels of fair wage.

 (b)There can be no doubt that in our march towards a truly fair wage inthe first instance and ultimately the living wage we must first achieve the need-based minimum. In determining family budgets so as to discover the worker's normal needs which the minimum wage regulations ought to satisfy the size of the standard family is very necessary to fix. One method is to take simple statistical average of the family size and another is to take into account some other factors such as the frequency of variations in family sizes in certain region and employments, the number of wage earners -available at different stages, and the increase or decrease in consumption at different stages in employment, that is, the age structure and its bearing on consumption.
 The plain averages laid down in the Resolution may have to be weighted in different regions and in different industries and reduced in others. [52 F-H] Crown Aluminium Works v. Workmen,[1958]t L.L.J. 1, referred to.
 (c)Although the 3 consumption units formula is if anything on the low side the National Tribunal could not be said to be wrong, in the present circumstances, in accepting 2.25 consumption units. But by graduates increase the consumption units must be raised to 3 within five years of service. [52F; 53C] (d)The Tripartite Conference of 1957 was a very representative body. There must be attached proper value to its Resolution on wage policy. The Resolution was passed on to indicate a first step towards achieving I" living wage. Unfortunately, we ire constantly finding that basic wage, instead ofmoving to subsistence plus level, tends to sag to poverty level when thereis a rise in prices. To overcome this tendency our wage structure has for a long time been composed of two items (a) the basic wage, and (b) a dearness allowance which is altered to neutralise, if not entirely, at least the greater part of the increased cog,, of living. This does not solve the problem of real wage. At the same time, we have to beware that too sharp an upward movement of basic wage is likely to affect the cost of production and lead to fall in our exports and to the raising of prices all-round. There is a vicious circle which can be broken by increased production and not by increasing wages. What we need is the introduction of production bonus increased fringe benefits, free medical, educational and insurance facilities. As a counterpart to this capital must also be prepared to forego a part of its return. There is much to be said for considering the need-base formula in all its implications for it is bound to be our first step towards living wage.
 As in many other matters relating to industrial disputes the problem may, perhaps. be best tackled by agreement between, Capital and Labour in in establishment where a beginning can be safely made in this direction. [54 E-H] East Asiatic Co. v. Workmen [1962]2 L.L.J. 610 referred to.
 (e)Without further data it is difficult to determine what coefficient shouldbe applied to the working class wage for the purpose of determiningthe need-based minimum wage of clerical staff. When fresh and comprehensive enquiries are conducted, the results would show whether the coefficient should go up or down. With the rise of wages to higher 29 levels among the working class the differential is bound to be lower and this is a matter for inquiry. Till then there is no alternative but to adhere to the coefficient already established. [56 F-G] (iii)Seniority and merit should ordinarily both have a part in promotion to higher ranks and should temper each other. 'The National Tribunal was right in thinking that there was little scope for giving directions to the Bank in this regard. [57 F-G] (iv)Gratuity is not a gift but is earned and for feiture except to recoup a loss occasioned to the establishment is not justified. [58F] Express Newspaper (P) Ltd. & Anr. v.

 Burhanpur Tapti Mills Mazdoor Sangh, A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 839, referred to.
 (v)The Tribunal rightly declined to accept the demand that the Association and the Union should be allowed to participate and represent workem in disputes between individual workmen and the Reserve Bank. This would make internal administration impossible. [60B] (vi)In making its award operate from January 1, 1962 and rejecting the appellants' demand that it should come into force from November 1, 1957 or at least from March 21, 1960, the National Tribunal did not act unreasonably. Ordinarily an award comes into operation from the time ,stated in sub- 
9. (1) of s. 17A of the Industrial Disputes Act. I.e. on the expiry of thirty days from the date of its publication.
 The Tribunal however is given power to make, it applicable from another date, and it could not be said that in the present case the discretion had not been exercised on judicial principles.
