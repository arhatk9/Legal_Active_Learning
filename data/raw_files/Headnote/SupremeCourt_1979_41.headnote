 The appellants were persons to whom gifts of agricultural lands were made before July 30, 1958, for love and affection, by non-related donors. The Revenue authorities decided that these gifts were not protected by s. 32FF of the PEPSU Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1955, as there had been no valuable "consideration", within the meaning of that section. A Division Bench of the Haryana High Court upheld the dismissal of the appellants' writ petition, by a single Judge of that court.
 Dismissing the appeals the Court, ^ 
 HELD : It is the essence of a gift as defined in the Transfer of Property Act, that it should be without "consideration" of the nature defined in s. 2(d) of the Contract Act, and as section 32FF of the Act saves only the transfer or disposition of land for "consideration" upto the limit specified in it, the gifts under dispute, will not fall within the purview of that section. Any other view of the section would defeat the purpose of Chapter IV-A of the Act, which provides for ceiling on land and acquisition and disposal of surplus area. [234 E, G, H-235 A] James Newton v.
