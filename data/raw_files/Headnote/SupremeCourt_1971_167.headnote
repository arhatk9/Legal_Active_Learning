 The original assessment of the assessee for the assessment year 1944-45 was made sometime before March 13, 1953.
 Subsequently after obtaining the sanction of the Commissioner of Income-tax, the Income-tax Officer reopened the assessment under s. 34(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. On March 13, 1953 he issued a notice to the assessee under s. 34 read with s. 22(2) of the Act. After considering the objection of the assessee, the Income-tax Officer made an assessment order under s. 34 read with s. 23 (4) of the Act on March 8, 1954 in which he computed the income of the assessee. But on that day he did not determine the tax due from the assessee. He determined the tax and issued a notice under s. 29(3) in Form 30 only on March 31, 1954. The assessee contended that the assessment was barred under s. 34(3). The contention was rejected by the authorities under the Act including the appellate tribunal but the High Court gave its advisory opinion in favour of the assessee. In appeal to this Court by the Revenue the main question for consideration was whether the assessment was complete on the date when the income was assessed by the Income-tax Officer or on the date when the tax was computed.
 HELD:The appeal must fail.
 As long back as September 24, 1953 the High Court of Madras in Vishwanathan Chettiar's case came to the conclusion that the word 'assessments in the proviso to s. 34(3) means not merely the computation of the income of the assessee but also the determination of the tax payable by him. No other High Court has taken a different view. The Revenue must have in all these years acted on the basis of that decision of the Madras High Court. Interpretation of a provision in a taxing statute rendered years back and accepted and acted upon by the department should not be easily departed from.
 The corresponding provisions of the 1961 Act are materially different from the provisions of the 1922 Act. Under these circumstances this Court would not be justified in departing from the interpretation placed by the High Court in Viswanathan Chettia's case though a different view of the law may be reasonably possible. [954F-H] RM.P.R. Viswanathan Chettiar v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, 25 I.T.R. 79, affirmed.
