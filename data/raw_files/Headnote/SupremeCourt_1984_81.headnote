 The petitioners are purchasers of lands which had been originally granted by the State to persons belonging to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribes. Such lands had been originally granted to persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the provisions of Law or on the basis of rules or regulations governing such grant. After the passing of the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands Act), 1978, notices have been issued by the appropriate authority to the transferees of such lands to show cause as to why the lands transferred to them should not be resumed for being restored to the original grantees or their legal heirs or for distribution otherwise to the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in accordance with the provisions of the Statute, as the transfers in their favour are in view of the provisions of the Act now null and void. The appellants, who were aggrieved by the said notices challenged the vires of the Act. According to them, ss. 4 & 5 of the Act violated the provisions of Arts 14, 19 (1) (f), 31 and 31A of the Constitution. The High Court for reasons recorded in the Judgment upheld the validity of the Act and dismissed the petitions. However, the High Court granted certificates under Arts. 132 & 133 of the Constitution and hence the appeals.
 Dismissing the appeals, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1 : 1. Sections 4 & 5 of the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfers of Certain Lands) Act, 1978 is constitutionally valid. [5101F] 503 1 : 2. However, the provisions of the Act must be read down and held that the Act will apply to transfers of granted lands made in breach of the condition imposing prohibition of transfer of granted lands only in those cases where the title acquired by the transferee was still voidable at the date of the commencement of the Act and had not lost its defeasible character at the date when the Act came into force. Transferees of granted land having a perfected and not a voidable title at the commencement of the Act must be held to be outside the pale of the provisions of the Act. S. 4 of the Act must be so construed as not to have the effect of rendering void the title of any transferee which was not voidable at the date of the commencement of the Act. Granted lands which had been transferred after the expiry of the period of prohibition do not come within the purview of the Act, and cannot be proceeded against under the provisions of this Act. The provisions of the Act make this position clear, as ss. 4 & 5 become applicable only when granted lands are transferred in breach of the condition relating to prohibition of such lands. Granted lands transferred before the commencement of the Act and not in contravention of prohibition on transfer are clearly beyond the scope and purview of the present Act.
 Also in case where granted lands had been transferred before the commencement of the Act in violation of the condition regarding prohibition on such transfer and the transferee who had initially acquired only a voidable title in such granted lands had perfected his title in the granted lands by prescription by long and continuous enjoyment thereof in accordance with law before the commencement of the Act, such granted lands would also not come within the purview of the present Act, as the title of such transferees to the granted lands has been perfected before the commencement of the Act.
 Since at the date of the commencement of the Act the title of such transferees had ceased to be voidable by reason of acquisition of prescriptive rights on account of long and continued user for the requisite period, the title of such transferees could not be rendered void by virtue of the provisions of the Act without violating the constitutional guarantee. [520D-H, 521A-C] 1 : 3. As the provisions of appeal has been incorporated by the Amending Act which received the assent of the Governor on the 29th February, 1984 and first came to be published in the Karnataka Gazette Extraordinary on the 3rd day of March, 1984, the Deputy Commissioner to whom the appeal will be presented will no doubt take this fact into consideration in deciding the question of limitation in regard to any appeal which may be filed against an order of the Assistant Commissioner; if any appeal is preferred within a period of three months from the date the amended provision conferring the right of appeal came into force, the Deputy Commissioner taking into consideration the fact that a period of three months has been prescribed for preferring an appeal from the date of the order of the Assistant Commissioner, may have no difficulty in entertaining the appeal by condoning the deal under s. 5 of the Limitation Act in terms of the power conferred on the Deputy Commissioner under the said s. 5A, provided the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that the appeal is otherwise maintainable and the interest of justice requires that the appeal should be entertained and not be thrown out on the ground of limitation. [521-D-G] 504 1 : 4. It is no doubt true that before the passing of the present Act any transfer of granted land in breach of the condition relating to prohibition on such transfer would not have the effect of rendering the transfer void and would make any such transfer only voidable. But the State, consistently with the directive principles of the Constitution, has made it a policy and very rightly, to preserve, protect and promote the interest of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which by and large form the weaker and poorer sections of the people in our country.
 This may be said to be the declared policy of the State and the provisions seeking to nullify such transfers is quite in keeping with the policy of the State which may properly be regarded as public policy for rendering social and economic justice to these weaker sections of the society.
 In pursuance of this policy, the legislature is undoubtedly competent to pass an enactment providing that transfers of such granted lands will be void and not merely voidable for properly safeguarding and protecting the interests of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for whose benefit only these lands had been granted. Even under the Contract Act, any Contract which is opposed to public policy is rendered void. [512D-E, 513C-E] 1 : 5. Even in the absence of any such statutory provisions, the transfer of granted lands in contravention of the terms of the grant or in breach of any law, rule or regulation covering such grant will clearly be voidable and the resumption of such granted lands after avoiding the voidable transfers in accordance with law will be permitted.
 Avoidance of such voidable transfers and resumption of the granted lands through process of law is bound to take time Any negligence and delay on the part of the authorities entitled to take action to avoid such transfers through appropriate legal process of law is bound to take time. Any negligence and dealy on the part of the authorities entitled to take action to avoid such transfers through appropriate legal process for resumption of such grant may be further impediments in the matter of avoiding such transfers and resumption of possession of the granted lands. Prolonged legal proceedings will undoubtedly be prejudicial to the interests of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for whose benefit the granted lands are intended to be resumed. As transfers of granted lands in contravention of the terms of the grant or any law, regulation or rule governing such grants can be legally avoided and possession of such lands can be recovered through process of law the Legislature for the purpose of avoiding delay and harassment of protracted litigation and in furthering its object of speedy restoration of these granted lands to the members of the weaker communities is perfectly competent to make suitable provision for resumption of such granted lands by stipulating in the enactment that transfers of such lands in contravention of the terms of the grant or any regulation, rule or law regulating such grant will be void in providing a suitable procedure consistent with the principles of natural justice for achieving this purpose without recourse to prolonged litigation in Court in the larger interests of benefiting the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
 [513F-H, 514A-D] 2 : 1. Any person who acquires such granted land by transfer from the original grantee in breach of the condition relating to prohibition on such transfer must necessarily be presumed to be aware of the prohibition imposed on the transfer of such granted land, and they cannot be considered to be a 505 bona fide purchaser for value; and every such transferee acquires to his knowledge only avoidable title to the granted land. The title acquired by such transfer is defeasible and is liable to be defeated by an appropriate action taken in this regard. If the Legislature under such circumstances seek to intervene in the interests of these weaker sections of the community and choose to substitute a speedies and cheaper method or recovery of these granted lands which were otherwise liable to be resumed through legal process, it cannot be said that any vested rights of the transferees are affected. Transferees of granted lands with full knowledge of the legal position that the transfers made in their favour in contravention of the terms of grant or any law, rule or regulation governing such grant are liable to be defeated in law, cannot and do not have in law or equity, a genuine or real grievance that their defeasible title in such granted lands so transferred is, in fact, being defeated and they are being dispossessed of such lands from which they were in law liable to be dispossessed by process of law. [514F-H, 515A-C] 2 : 2. The position will, however, be somewhat different where the transferees have acquired such granted lands not in violation of any term of the grant of any law regulating such grant as also where any transferee who may have acquired a defeasible title in such granted lands by the transfer thereof in contravention of the terms or the grant or any law regulating such grant has perfected his title by prescription of time or otherwise. [515C-D] 2 : 3. But where the transferee acquires only a defeasible title liable to be defeated in accordance with law, avoidance of such defeasible title which still remains liable to be defeated in accordance with law at the date of commencement of the Act and recovery of the possession of such granted land on the basis of the provisions contained in ss. 4 & 5 of the Act cannot be said to be constitutionally invalid and such provision cannot be termed as unconscionable, unjust and arbitrary. [515D-E] 3 : 1. Granted lands were intended for the benefit and enjoyment of the original grantees who happen to belong to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The condition imposed against the transfer for a particular period of such granted lands which were granted essentially for the benefit of the grantees cannot be said to constitute any unreasonable restriction. The granted lands were not in the nature of properties acquired and held by the grantees in the sense of acquisition, or holding or property within the meaning of Art. 19 (1) (f) of the Constitution. It was a case of a grant by the owner of the land to the grantee for the possession and enjoyment of the granted lands by the grantees and the prohibition on transfer of such granted lands for the specified period was an essential term or condition on the basis of which the grant was made. The prohibition on transfer was not for an indefinite period or perpetual. It was only for a particular period, the object being that the grantees should enjoy the granted lands themselves at least for the period during which the prohibition was to remain operative. Persons belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to whom the lands were granted were, because of their poverty, lack of education and general backwardness, exploited by various persons who could and would take advantage of 506 bona fide the said plight of these poor persons for depriving them of their lands. The imposition of the condition of prohibition on transfer for a particular period could not, therefore, be considered to constitute any unreasonable restriction on the right of the grantees to dispose of the granted lands. The imposition of such a condition on prohibition in the very nature of the grant was perfectly valid and legal. [575G-H, 516A-B, E-F] 3 : 2. The transferees of the granted lands from the original grantees, acquired the lands improperly and illegally in contravention of the condition imposed on such transfers. Such transferees must have been aware and must in any event be deemed to have been aware of the condition regarding the prohibition on transfer and they cannot be considered to be bona fide transferees for value. Such persons acquired in the granted lands only avoidable title which was liable to be defeated and possession of such lands could be resumed from such transferees. Such a person who only acquires a defeasible legal right cannot make a grievance of any violation of Art. 19 (1) (f) of the Constitution, when the defeasible legal right is, in fact, defeated by appropriate legal action or by any suitable provision enacted in an Act passed by the competent legislature. Further in most cases such transferees have after the transfer, which is liable to be avoided in accordance with law, enjoyed for a sufficiently long period the benefits of lands transferred to them before the lands could be recovered from them Art. 19 (1) (f), therefore, did not invalidate s. 4 of the Act. [516G-H, 517A-B] 3 : 3. The right or property which a transferee acquires in the granted lands, is a defeasible right and the transferee renders himself liable to lose his right or property at the instance of the grantor. This kind of defeasible right of the transferee in the granted lands cannot be considered to be property as contemplated in art.
 31 and 31A. The nature of the right of the transferee in the granted lands on transfer of such lands in breach of the condition prohibition relating to such transfer, the object of such grant and the terms therefore, also the law governing such grants and the object and the scheme of the presents Act enacted for the benefit of the weaker sections of our community, clearly go to indicate that there is in this case no deprivation of such right or property as may attract the provisions of Art. 31 and 31A of the Constitution. [517C-G] With the enactment of the Act, the, voidable right or title of the transferee in the grant lands becomes void and the transferee is left with no right or property in the granted lands. The lands which are sought to be recovered from the transferees of the granted lands are lands in which the transferees cease to have any interest or property. The effect of the provisions contained in ss. 4 & 5 of the Act is that the defeasible right or interest of the transferees in the granted lands is defeated and the voidable transaction is rendered void. As soon as such transferees are rendered void by virtue of the provisions of the Act transferee does not have any right in the granted lands so transferred, and possession is sought to be recovered of such lands in which the transferees have lost their right and interest. Therefore, the question of acquisition of any property by the State or any modification or extinguishment of right of property does not really arise and Art. 31A cannot be applied. Therefore, there is no infringement of Arts. 31 & 31A of the Constitution. [518D-H] 507 
 4. The special provisions made for the resumption of granted lands originally granted to the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and resoration of the same to the original grantees or their heirs and legal representatives and falling them to other members of these communities do not infringe Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 This Act has undoubtedly been passed for the benefit of members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are recognised as backward citizens and weaker sections in the country. There cannot be any manner of doubt that persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes can be considered to be separate and distinct classes particularly in the matter of preservation and protection of their economic and educational interests. In view of the peculiar plight of these two classes, the Constitution in Art. 15 (4) makes specific mention of these two classes and in Art.16 (4) speaks of backward class of citizens. One of the directive principles as contained in Art. 46 of the Constitution enjoins that "the State shall promote with special care and educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation." The object of this Act is to protect and preserve the economic interests of persons belonging to Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes and to prevent their exploitation. For the purpose of the present Act, the classification has a clear nexus to the object sought to be achieved.
 [519 A-F] 
 5. It is true there was no provision for any appeal in the original Act. It may be that such a provision was not originally made, as the Legislature might have felt that providing for an appeal would unnecessarily prolong the proceedings and might defeat the purpose of the act.
 However, the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) (Amendment) Act, 1984 (Karnataka Act III of 1984) now provides a suitable provision for appeal against an order of the Assistant Commissioner under s.5A. [519G-H, 520A]
