 The Income-tax Officer disallowed the increase in the remuneration off the Directors and Officers of the assessee- company since the increase was not reflected in ',he increase in the profits of the assessee and was on that account not expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business under s. 10(2)(xv) of the Income-,tax Act. The order was modified by the Appellate Tribunal. On reference the High Court answered the question against the Revenue, holding that the Tribunal acted without evidence in partially disallowing the increase in respect of certain officers.
 In appeal to this Court, HELD : The appeal must be dismissed.
 The practice of recording a decision without reasons in support cannot but be severely deprecated. Though the Tribunal is not a Court, it is invested with judicial power to lie exercised in manner similar to the procedure.
 Authority to "pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit" in s. 33(4) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 is not arbitrary; the expression is intended to define the jurisdiction or the Tribunal to deal with and determine questions which arise out of the subject-matter of the appeal in the light of the evidence, and consistently with the justice of the case. In the hierarchy of authorities the Appellate Tribunal is the final factfinding body : its decisions on questions of fact are not liable to be questioned before the High Court.
 [216H-217C] When a claim for allowance under s. 10(2)(xv) of the Income tax Act is made, the income-tax authorities have to decide whether the expenditure claimed as an allowance was incurred voluntarily and on grounds of commercial expediency. In applying the test of commercial expediency for determining whether the expenditure was wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of -the business, reasonableness, of tile expenditure must be adjudged from the point of view of the businessman and not of the Revenue. An employer in, fixing the remuneration of his employees is entitled to consider the extent of his business, the nature of the duties to be performed, and the special altitude of the employee, future Prospects of extension of the business and a host of other related circumstances. The rule that increased remuneration can only be justified if there be corresponding increase in the profits of the employer is erroneous. [217F-218B] 218B]
