 The Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act 1973 by Section 1(3) as amended by the Amending Act 1978 (Act 16 of 1978) provides: "Nothing in this Act shall apply to any building the construction of which is completed on or after the commencement of this Act for a period of ten years from the date of its completion".
 The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of Section 1(3) of the Act on the grounds: (i) that the provision seeks to make an invidious distinction between buildings constructed before the commencement of this Act and buildings the construction of which was completed on or after the commencement of this Act and on the basis of this invidious distinction this provision discriminates between the landlords and tenants of buildings constructed before the Act and after the Act inasmuch as a landlord enjoys in case of buildings construction of which is completed on or after the commencement of the Act an exemption from the operation of the Act and the tenant in respect of such building is denied the protection and the benefits of the Act for a period of 10 years from the date of completion of the construction of the building, whereas the landlord of any building constructed before the commencement of the Act does not enjoy any such exemption and the tenant of such building enjoys the protection and all the benefits of the Act. Thus, the discrimination between one class of landlords and their tenants and the other class of landlords and their tenants on the basis of the time of completion of the buildings is clearly arbitrary and is violative of Art. 14 of the Construction; and (ii) that the retrospective operation of the Act has the effect of taking away the vested right of the tenant and must, therefore, be held to be illegal and bad.

 HELD: 1(1) Section 1(3) of the Act as amended by the Amending Act of 1978 (Act 16 of 1978) is constitutionally valid. Any incentive offered for the purpose of construction of new buildings with the object of easing the situation of scarcity of accommodation for ameliorating the conditions of the tenants, cannot be said to be unreasonable, provided the nature and character of the incentive and the measure of exemption allowed are not otherwise unreasonable and arbitrary. The exemption to be allowed must be for a reasonable and a definite period. An exemption for an indefinite period or a period which in the facts and circumstances of any particular case may be considered to be unduly long, may be held to be arbitrary. The exemption must necessarily be effective from a particular date and must be with the object of promoting new constructions. In the instant case, the provision for exemption from the operation of the Rent Control Legislation by way of incentive to persons with means to construct new houses has been made in Section 1(3) of the Act by the Legislature in the legitimate hope that construction of new buildings will ultimately result in mitigation of the hardship of the tenants. Such incentive has a clear nexus with the object to be achieved and cannot be considered to be unreasonable or arbitrary.
 With the commencement of the Act, the provisions of the Rent Act with all the restrictions and rigours become effective.
 Buildings which have been constructed before the commencement of the Act were already there and the question of any kind of impetus or incentive to such buildings does not arise. The Legislature, therefore, very appropriately allowed the benefit of the exemption to the buildings, the construction of which commenced or was completed on or after the commencement of the Act. This exemption in respect of buildings coming up or to come up on or after the date of commencement of the Act is likely to serve the purpose of encouraging new buildings to be contracted. There is therefore, nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in fixing the date of commencement of the Act from which the exemption is to be operative. [866 D-H] (ii) The exemption for a period of 10 years from the operation of the Act allowed to buildings, the construction of which commenced or was completed on or after the date of commencement of the Act, is fair and reasonable. It is for a definite period and that period of exemption cannot be considered to be too long; and this exemption, the Legislature may be of the view, will serve the purpose of encouraging the construction of new buildings. It is for the Legislature to decide the period of exemption that may be allowed and to fix the date from which the period of 861 exemption should run. This will ordinarily be a matter of Legislative policy and this Court will not normally interfere unless the Court is of the opinion that the period of exemption or the date from which the exemption is to operate is unreasonable and arbitrary. [867 A-C] 
 2. The classification of buildings with reference to the date of commencement of the Act, namely, buildings constructed before the commencement of the Act and buildings the construction of which was completed on or after the date of the commencement of the Act, has a rational basis and has a clear nexus with the object to be achieved. The classification of the landlord and the tenant of a house constructed before the commencement of the Act and the landlord and tenant of a house, constructed before the commencement of the Act, is clearly founded on an intelligible differentia which has a rational relation to the object and this classification does not result in any invidious discrimination between the classes of landlords and tenants so classified. This classification is not arbitrary and is not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. [867 C-E] 
 3. The Section on its proper construction clearly indicates that the section is not retrospective in operation. Merely because the buildings the construction of which commenced or was completed after the date of commencement of the Act in 1973, come within the purview of the this particular provision which was introduced by amendment in 1978, the provision does not become retrospective. This provision operates prospectively and becomes effective after its incorporation in the Act by the Amendment, though the buildings completed on or after the commencement of this Act in 1973 are brought within the scope of this Section. The argument that the tenants have acquired a vested right under the Act prior to its amendment is without any substance. Prior to the amendment of Section 1(3) by the Amending Act of 1978, the provision as it originally stood cannot be said to have conferred any vested right on the tenants.
