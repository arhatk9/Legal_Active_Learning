 The appellant was a clerk in the Bank of Baroda. A charge sheet was served upon him. After holding departmental enquiry he was dismissed from service. An appeal filed by the workman against the dismissal was dismissed.
 Thereafter, the matter was referred to conciliation. On failure of conciliation, the Government referred the dispute to the Industrial Tribunal under section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The respondent raised a preliminary objection before the Tribunal that as no demand in respect of the appellant was made upon the management there was no industrial dispute in existence and, therefore, the reference made by the Government under section 10 was incompetent. The Tribunal upheld the said preliminary objection on the ground that as no demand was made by the Government either oral or in writing before approaching the conciliation officer there was no dispute in existence on the date of the reference.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : 1. Section 2(k) of the Act defines industrial dispute which requires that there should be a dispute connected with the employment or nonemployment or terms of employment inter alia between the employers and workmen. The Act nowhere contemplates that the dispute would come into existence in any particular specific or prescribed manner. For coming into existence of an industrial dispute a written demand is not sine qua non.

2. The key words in the definition of Industrial dispute are dispute or difference. The term industrial dispute connotes a real and substantial difference having some element of persistency and continuity till resolved and likely if not adjusted to endanger the industrial peace of the undertaking or the community. To read into definition the requirement of written demand for bringing into existence an industrial dispute would tantamount to rewriting the section. The power conferred by section 10(1) on the Government to refer the dispute can be exercised not only where the industrial dispute exists but when it is also apprehended. In making a reference under section 10(1) the Government is doing an administrative act and the fact that it has to form an opinion as to the factual existence of an industrial dispute as a preliminary step to the discharge of its function does not make it any the less administrative in character. [795 D-E, F-H, 796 A] Madras State v. C. P. Sarathy, [1952] INSC 69; AIR 1953 SC 52 and Sindhu Resettlelment Corporation Ltd. v. Industrial Tribunal, [1968] LLJ 834, referred to.
 
3. The question whether an industrial dispute exists on the date of reference is a question of fact to be determined on the material placed before the Tribunal. [796 D] 
4. 'In the present case the Tribunal completely misdirected itself when it observed that no demand was made by the workman claiming reinstatement after dismissal. When the enquiry was held it is an admitted position that the workman appeared and claimed reinstatement. After his dismissal he 794 preferred an appeal to the appellate forum and contended that the order of dismissal was wrong and that in any event he should be reinstated in service. When the Union approached the Conciliation Officer,the Management appeared and contested the claim for reinstatement. There is thus unimpeachable evidence that the concerned workman persistently demanded reinstatement. [796 E-H, 797 A]
