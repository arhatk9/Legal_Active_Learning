 On January 31, 1958, a notification was issued by the State Government under s. 4(2) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1950, exempting from tax the sale of any garment the value of which did not exceed Rs. 4. In a writ petition filed by a manufacturer of vests and underwears, (hosiery articles the High Court held that the notification covered hosiery articles also. On March 26, 1962, the State Government issued another notification under s. 4(2) of the Act exempting from tax the sale of any garment the value of which did not exceed Rs. 4 but the exemption was not made ,applicable to 'hosiery products and hats of all kinds'.
 The appellants who were doing business in vests and underwears of knitted fabric challenged in writ petitions the notifications on the ground that it violated Art. 14 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the petitions and held vests and underwears came under 'hosiery product'.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) A taxing status can be challenged on the ground of infringement of Art. 14, but since the Legislature possesses a large freedom of classification in matters of taxation, it can exercise wide discretion in selecting persons or objects which will be taxed, and, a statute is not open to attack on the there ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others. It must be shown that within the range of its selection the law operates unequally. Therefore, it is not for the Court to decide whether the policy of exempting articles made from woven cloth was justified or that hosiery articles should also be given the same exemption. [397 G-H; 398 A] (2) The High Court ought not to have gone into the matter whether vests and underwears are hosiery products as it was for the assessing authorities to decide, in each case, whether the taxed goods were hosiery products.[1398 F-G]
