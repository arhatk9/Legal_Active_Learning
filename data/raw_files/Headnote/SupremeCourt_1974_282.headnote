 The petitioner was detained under MISA on the grounds that on 2 occasions, he along with his associates, hurled bombs on a tea-stall and on a watch repairing shop, thereby damaging furniture, watches showcases etc., endangering the lives and safety of the people; and creating a great disturbance of public order.
 In a habeas corpus petition, the petitioner challenged the grounds of detention as "Vague, false, malafide, fanciful & nonexistent, that there was no rational nexus between the grounds with permissible objects of preventive detention and that the, offences mentioned in the ground could be the subject-matter of ordinary criminal prosecutions but not of public order, the breach of which is something more serious than mere breach of the Criminal Law of the land.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD:(1) "Public Order" is necessarily an elastic concept which is wider than the "security of the State"-a category separated in the Act from it by the disjunctive "or." [66B] (2)In some cases, the facts may clearly indicate that an ordinary criminal prosecution would suffice and the present case, is not one of those cases. [66C] (3)In a case of detention, the Court has to be careful to avoid substituting its own opinion about what is enough for the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authorities.
 and interference could be justified only if it is clear that no reasonperson could possibly be satisfied about the need to detain the person on the ground saved. The required satisfaction must have reference to a need to prevent what is anticipatedfrom the detenu. The past conduct or activity is only relevant in so far as it furnished reasonable grounds for an a apprehension. Prevention and punishment have some, common ultimate aims but their immediate objectives and modes of action are distinguishable. [66D] (4)In the Present ease, the petitioner was given a personal hearing by the Advisory gourd. The Board heard another detenu. who was released )later. The Board did not think that the petitioner should be released. It shows that the Advisory Board did apply its mind to the case of the petitioner. [67H] (5)As regards non-application of the minds of the detaining authorities, the facts of the case speak otherwise. As regards the affidavit sworn by the Tea-shop owner whose shop was attacked, that the petitioner did not attack his shot). were considered by a division bench of the Calcutta High and it rightly held that the affidavit could not vitiate the initial detention order which was passed at a time when no such affidavit was either before the detaining authorities or placed before the Advisory Board.
 [68D] (6)So far as the second representation of the petitioner to the State Govt. is concerned, under Sec. 14 of the Act, the State Govt. can revoke or modify a detention order at any time. Sec. 14 of the Act apparently vests a wider power than that which the State Govt. may have possessed under Sec. 21 of the General Clauses Act 1897, which is by having been specifically mentioned in Sec. 14 of the Act, makes it clear the power under Sec. 14 is not necessarily subject to the provision of Sec. 21 of the General Clauses Act. This means that a revocation or modification of an order of the State Govt.
 64 is possible even without complying with the restriction laid down in Sec. 21 of the General Clauses Act; but a correct interpretation of the two provisions would be that it is left to the State Govt. in the exercise of its discretion, either to exercise the power read with provisions of Sec. 21 of the General Clauses Act or without the aid of Sec. 21.
 [69B-D] (7)Further, it will be reasonable that judicious exercise of the power tinder Sec. 14 of the Act to refer a case once again to the, Advisory Board for its opinion before the subsequent representation made on fresh material by a detenu is rejected and the Advisory Board can then adopt such parts of the procedure laid down in Sec. 11 of the Act as could be applied to a second representation. [69E-F; 70B] (8)On a habeas corpus petition, what has to be considered by the Court is whether the detention is prima facie legal or not, and not whether the detaining authorities have wrongly or rightly reached a satisfaction on every question of fact. Further, in a habeas Corpus petition, the petitioner has to show, in a case under Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971. that there has been a violation of either Art. 21 or Art. 22 of the constitution. [70E-F;
 71A] in the present case, the Court directs that the State Govt.
 would consider and take an early decision upon the pending fresh representation of the petitioner in accordance with the law laid down above.
