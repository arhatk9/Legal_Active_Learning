 The appellant was a member of the East India Jute and Hessian Exchange Limited, the only association recognised under the provisions of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act 1952. The respondent was not a member of the association. On December 21, 1962 a transaction was entered into between the parties by means of letter written by the responden, to the appellant. It was agreed between the parties that apart from the terms mentioned in the letter all other terms and conditions of the East India and Hessian Exchange standard contract would be applicable to the contract. The standard contract 'forms and the rules and bye-laws of the Exchange inter alia, provided for arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Indusrry.
 On disputes arising between the parties the appellant referred its claim to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. When the Chamber proceeded with the arbitration pursuant to the reference the respondent filed a petition before the Calcutta High Court under s. 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940. The High Court came to the conclusion that the contracts in question violated bye- laws 1 (b) and 15 in Ch. V of the Working Manual and the contravention of these bye-laws rendered the contracts illegal under the provision is of bye-law 17 of the same Chapter. In particular the High Court noticed the absence of any term in "he contracts similar to cl. (2) in the prescribed form in Appendix 11 which read : "Buyers to give...... clear working days notice to place goods alongside." Appeal against the judgment of the High Court was filed by special leave.
 
HELD : The High Court was right in holding that the contracts in question were not in the prescribed form and thus they did not comply with the requirement of bye-law 1 of Ch. V. There can be no manner of doubt that bye-law is mandatory when read with bye-laws 15 and 17. [756 g] Under bye-law 15 no member shall enter into any transferable specific delivery contract otherwise than on terms and conditions prescribed under the bye-laws and under bye-law 17 if there is a contravention, inter alia of bye-law 15 the contract shall be rendered illegal by virtue of the provi- sion contained in s. 15(3A) of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act. Section 11(3)(aa) specifically empowers the Exchange to make bye-laws the contravention of any of which shall make a forward contract entered into otherwise than in accordance with such bye-laws illegal. If, therefore, the contracts in question did not comply with the requirement of bylaw I (b) of Ch. V they would be rendered illegal and void. [ 756 H, 757 A]' There was non-compliance with condition No. 2 despite the fact that in the letters evidencing the contracts it was mentioned that all other terms 7 5 2 :and condition of the standard contracts of the Exchange would be applicable. Even if it was not necessary to use the same language the number of clear working days had to be specified which was not done in the contracts in dispute.
 Condition No. 2 cannot be said to be inconsequential because it must be stipulated how many working days notice has to be given by the buyers to place goods alongside "export vessel, in the Port of Calcutta." [757 C-D] In the result the appeal must fail.
