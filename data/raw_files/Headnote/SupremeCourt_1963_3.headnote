 The first petitioner, a Company with its registered office at Calcutta, is-the owner of a factory at Varanasi in the State of Uttar Pradesh. The State of Uttar Pradesh having agreed to advance a loan oh the mortgage of the Company's assets at its jute mills at Budge Budge and at Ghusuri, all situated in West Bengal, the deed of mortgage was executed at Lucknow in the State of Uttar Pradesh on March 22, 1957.
 To that deed, the petitioner affixed stamps of the value of Rs. 1,08,751/purchased from the Collector of stamps, Calcutta. It was duly registered at Calcutta on April 5, 1957. On a reference made to the Board of Revenue, Uttar Pradesh, the Board held that as the mortgage deed dated March 22, 1957, was executed at a place within Uttar Pradesh it must bear stamps issued by the Uttar Pradesh Government.
 The Board also held that the Company was liable to pay Rs.
 1,74,000/- as stamp duty on the document dated March 22, 1957. The petitioner filed a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging the order of the Board of Revenue.
 The petitioner contended that the document should have been held to be duly stamped as it bore stamps in accordance with the law of West Bengal.
 Held, that the mortgage deed dated March 22, 1957, was executed in Uttar Pradesh, though it related to property situated in West Bengal and was received in the State for registration. The first dutiable event was the execution which took place in Uttar Pradesh. The second dutiable event was the receipt in West Bengal. When it came before the officers of Uttar Pradesh for a decision whether it was duly stamped or not, the officers of 536 Uttar Pradesh were bound to hold that the instrument was not duly stamped as it did not bear Uttar Pradesh stamps, In the circumstances of the case, the fact that the instrument had stamps in accordance with the law of West Bengal could not justify a conclusion that it had been duly stamped. The instrument can be said to be duly stamped only if it bears stamps of the amount and description in accordance with the law of the State concerned. The law includes not only the Act but also the rules framed under the Act.
 If an instrument after becoming liable to duty in one State on execution there becomes liable to duty also in another State on receipt there' it must first be stamped in accordance with the law of the first State and it will not be required to be further stamped in accordance with the law of the second State when the rate of the second state is the same or lower. Where the rate of the second Sate is higher, it will require to be stamped only with the excess amount in accordance with the law and rules in force in the second State.
