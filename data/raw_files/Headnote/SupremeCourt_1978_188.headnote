 Section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that in order to ascertain. whether a writing is that of the person by whom it purports to have been written any writing admitted or proved to the satisfaction of the court to have been written by that person may be compared with the one which is to be proved, although that signature, writing has not been produced or proved for any other purpose. Para 2 of the section provides that the court may direct any person present in court to write in words or figures for the purpose of enabling the court to compare words or figures alleged to have been written by such person.
 In the course of criminal proceedings before a magistrate the prosecution alleged that one of the basic documents which was of vital importance to establish the case against the accused was in the handwriting of the accused but it could not be compared by the handwriting expert with any specimen writing of the accused because the latter avoided to give any specimen writing and that in the interest of justice the court should direct him to give his specimen writing. Exercising the court's power under s. 73 of the Evidence Act the Magistrate directed the accused to give his specimen handwriting to have it examined by a handwriting expert.
 Revision preferred by the accused was dismissed by the Sessions Judge. The High Court, in the revision petition filed by the accused, held that the only purpose for which a court may direct any person present in the court including the accused person) to write words is to enable the court to compare the words and figures with any words and figures alleged to have been written by such person but where the purpose is to enable any of the parties to have the words so written compared from a handwriting expert of that party, the second paragraph of s. 73 would have no application. The High Court therefore held that the order of the Magistrate was beyond the scope of s. 73.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The Magistrate did not act beyond the scope of s.
 73 of the Evidence Act or in a manner which is not legal.
 
 1. The two paragraphs of s.73 are not mutually exclusive, but complementary to each other. The sample writing taken by the Court under the second paragraph of s.
 73 is in substance and reality, the same thing as "admitted writing" within the purview of the first paragraph of s. 73.
 The first paragraph does not specifically say by whom such comparison may be made but such comparison may be made by a handwriting expert (s. 45), or by one familiar with the handwriting of the person concerned (s. 47) or by the court.
 The section should be read as a whole in the light of s. 45.
 Thus 932 read it is clear that a court holding an enquiry under the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of an offence triable by itself or by the Court of Session, does not exceed its powers under s.73 if in the interests of justice it directs an accused person to give his simple writing to enable the same to be compared by a handwriting expert chosen or approved by the court, it is immatrial whether the expert's name was suggested by the prosecution or the defence because even in adopting this course the purpose is to enable the court to compare the disputed writing with his admitted writing and to reach its own conclusion with the assistance of an expert. [942G-H] In the instant case the circumstances which weighed with the Magistrate in making the order, included the contumacious conduct of the accused and the resiling of the material witness. It was apparent from the record that the accused was playing the game of hide and seek with the process of law. The Magistrate therefore had good reason to hold that the assistance of the Government Expert was essential in the interests of justice to enable the Magistrate to compare the sample with the questioned writing with expert assistance. Although the specimen handwriting was sought to be used for comparison by the expert the ultimate purpose was to enable the court to compare that specimen writing with the disputed one. [943E-F] 
 2. The fact that the Magistrate's order might result in filling up of loop holes in the prosecution case, as alleged by the accused, is a purely subsidiary factor which must give way to the paramount consideration of doing justice.
 [944B] 
 3. Moreover, s. 165 of the Evidence Act and s. 540 of Cr.P.C. 1898 invest the court with a wide discretion to call and examine anyone as a witness if the court is bona fide of opinion that his examination is necessary for is a just decision of the case. In passing the order the Magistrate was well within the bounds of this principle. [944D] 
 4. In the matter of comparing the handwriting the judge should not take upon himself the task of comparing the admitted writing with the disputed one to find out whether the one agrees, with other. A prudent course is to obtain the opinion and assistance of an expert. [944F] 
5. So far as the handwriting expert is concerned his real function is to put before the court all the materials together with the reasons which induce him to come to a conclusion. It is for the Court and the jury to form a judgment by their own observation of the materials. On receiving expert evidence the court should compare the handwriting with its own eyes for a proper assessment of the value of the total evidence. It is, therefore, not wrong to say that when a court seized of a case directs the accused person to give his specimen writing such direction is for the purpose of enabling the court to compare the writing so written with the writing alleged to have been written by such person within the contemplation of s. 73. [944G-H] Fakhruddin v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1967 SC 1326 referred to.
 
 6. Even where no expert is cited or examined by either party, the court may in the interests of justice call an expert witness, allow him to compare the sample writing with the alleged writing and thus give his expert assistance to enable the court to compare the two writings and arrive at a proper conclusion [946A-B] 933
