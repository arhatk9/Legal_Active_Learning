 The Rajasthan Colonisation (Bhakra Project Government Land Allotment and Sale) Rules, 1955 made under the provisions of the Rajasthan Colonisation Act, 1954, came into effect on 25th December, 1955. Under these Rules the difference between pre-1947 and post-1947 tenants is negligible. Under tile Rajasthan Colonisation (Gang Canal Lands Permanent Allotment and Sales) Rules, 1956, the scale of allotment is uniform without any discrimination between various classes of persons to whom land may be allotted. Under the Rajasthan Colonisation (Rajasthan Canal Project Government Land Allotment and Sale) Rules, 1967 all post-1955 temporary cultivation leases in the Colony area were terminated and all the lands covered by such leases reverted to the Government.
 Jaila Singh. the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1704 of 1974 was allotted 50 bighas of 'uncommand land' in the years 1956-57 and 1957-58 in the Ganga nagar District of the Rajasthan State. The area in which the land is situated was declared a Colony Area of the Rajasthan Canal Project tinder the Rajasthan Colonisation Act in 1960. In 1967 the Rajasthan Canal Colonisation (Rajasthan Canal Project Government Land Allotment and Site) Rules, 1967 were pro- mulgated and applications were invited for allotment of land under those rule,--,. Jaila Singh's application for allotment was disposed of on 27-12-1969 by allotting, 14 bighas and 14 bighas of land on permanent basis,. In State v. Ramdhan A.i.R. 1973 Raj. 71, the latter part of Rule 16 and Rule 19(a)(iii) i-eid with little 7(x) and (xi) of the 1967 Rules were struck down. Thev were struck down on the ground that both the Bhakra Canal Project Rules and the RIjasthLn ('anal Rules framed under the Act. had treated the unit of family differently and cannot therefore be justified. Thereafter, two sets of rules called, respectively Rajasthan Colonisation (Rajasthan Canal Project Pre-1955 Temporary Tenants (government Land Allotment) Conditions, 1971 ind the Rajasthan Colonisation (Allotment of Government Land to Post-1955 Temporary Cultivation Lease 'Holders ind Other- Landless Persons in the Rajasthan Canal Project Area) Rules. 1971 were promulgated. Applications- were again invited for allotment of land under- the Post- 1955 Rules and Jaila Singh was allotted another 10 bights of land. The rest of the land originally allotted to him reverted to the State. He filed a writ petition before the Rajasthan High Court challenging the Post-1955 Rules ,is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
 Sahi Rant, the husband of the appellant in Civil Appeal No.
 1705 of 1974. had been allotted 241 bighas of land for temporary cultivation in Rajasthan Canal Area in Ganganagar District. He had also been allotted 12-1 bighas 2 command land' in the year 1952 on a permanent basis and 6 bighas and 12 biswas of 'command land" and 4 bigha-, and 11 biswas of 'uncommand land' for permanent cultivation. These lands were included in the Colony Arei of the Rajasthan Canal Project in 1960.
 429 After the post-1955 Rule come into force the 24-1/2 bighas of land was ordered to be resumed on the ground that Sahi Ram was not a landless person In the writ petition filed by the appellant, the order of resumption was challenged as discriminatory.
 In both the writ partitions the contention on behalf of the State of Rajasthan was that, owing to the insertion of s.
 15A in the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 Khatedari rights could not accrue to the tenants under s. 15(1) of the said Act and 'the possession of such tenants was given protection who were holding since 15,10-53 and thereafter upto the commencement of the Pre-1955 Conditions by making permanent allotment under the Pre-1955 conditions". The Single Judge of the High Court accepted this contention and upheld their validity of the Pre-1955. Conditions as well as the Post- 1955 Rules. He took the view that the question of discrimination can arise only in respect of persons who are similarly situated, that the pre-1955 tenants cannot be said to stand on the same footing as the post-1955 tenants in as much as the two classes of tenants came into temporary cultivation at different periods of time and cannot be said to be similarly situated. On appeal, the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeals even at the admission stage. These appeals have been preferred by special leave granted by this Court.
 It was: contended for the appellants that discrimination between the pre-1955 and post-1955 tenants is based on the fact that (1) In the case of the former, pet-sons having more than 25 bighas could keep all the lands they had up to the ceiling limit and had to pay only for the; land in excess of 25 bighas ; (2) Even among them persons having less than 25 bighas, whether below 15 or above 15 bighas could get land to enable them to have 25 bighas and they need pay only for the excess over what they had. (3) Post- 1955 tenants could not get anything if they had over 15 bighas and the%, had to pay for the land allotted to them to make up 25 bighas.
 Allowing the appeals, 
HELD : There is no nexus between the pre-1955 Conditions and post-1955 Rules and the Rajasthan Tenancy Act which came into force on 15-10-1955. Both sets of leases had been cancelled by the relevant pre-1955 Condition and post-1955, Rules and there is no dispute that the pre-1955 leases cannot be cancelled while post-1955 leases could be cancelled. The Rajasthan Tenancy Act is not concerned with that question. Proviso to section 15 of that Act specifically provides that no Khatedari rights shall accrue under that section to any tenant, to whom land is or has been let out temporarily in Gang Canal, Bhakra, Chambal or Jawai project area, or any other area notified in that behalf by the State Government. Admittedly the Rajasthan Canal area has been included within the scope of this proviso by a notification. To make matters more clear section 15A also provides that the land in the Rajasthan Canal area leased out on any terms whatsoever shall be deemed to have been let out temporarily within the meaning of the poviso and no khatedari lights shall accrue or shall be deemed ever to have accrued in any such land leased Out.
 This provision thus applies to both pre-1955 as well as post-1955 leases. Both these leases stand on the same footing and; therefore (lo not form different classes. The reference to sections 15 and 15A of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act is wholly irrelevant. Nor can it be said that the lengthy occupation of the lands provides any proper criterion for the distinction between pre-1955 and post-1955 tenants. There is nothing to show how long before 15th October 1955 pre-1955 tenants were given temporary leases and in the absence of such material, it is impossible to see how any differentiation can be made between pre-1955 and post-1955 tenants in the matter of permanent allotment of land. Even in 1967 when the 1967 Rules were made no distinction was sought to be made between pre-1955 and post- 1955 tenants. By that time many of post-1955 tenant:, would have been in possession for about 12 years ,Ind in 1971 they would have beer, in possession for about 16 years. It is difficult lo appreciate how it should make any difference from the point of view of allotment of land, whether a tenant has been in occupation for 16 years or 18 or 20 years and why differentiation should be made with reference to the date when the Rajasthan Tenancy Act came into force. The classification must 430 have a nexus with the object sought to be achieved. There is no such nexus in this case. As a result Condition No. 3 of the Pre-1955 Conditions and the definition of landless person as contained in Rule 2(1)(xiii) as well as Rule 3(2) of the Post-1955 Rules are void as they are discriminatory under Art. 14 of the Constitution and they are struck down.
 [435 D-H, 436A-C, 437F, 438E] Observation:Rajasthan Colonisation Act, 1954, practically provides no guidance with regard to the principles to be applied in the matter of land. [432F]
