 The respondent manufactures and sells hume pipes and high quality and high pressure pipes. The pipes are rein- forced concrete pipes. The U.P. Government issued a noti- fication under the U.P. Sales Tax Act providing that "sani- tary fittings" were to be taxed at 7 per cent instead of 2 per cent. The Saks Tax Officer treated hume pipes supplies by the respondent as sanitary fittings and imposed sales tax @ 7 per cent. The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court assailing the order of the Sales Tax Officer on the ground that the hume pipes manufactured by the assessee could not by. any stretch of imagination he construed to be sanitary fittings nor were they ever used as such. The High Court after perusing the materials on record and hearing counsel accepted the plea of the respondent and held that the hume pipes could not be treated as sanitary fittings.
 The High Court accordingly quashed the assessment made by the Sales Tax Officer. The respondent also filed certifi- cates of Local Self Government Engineering Department, U.P.
 to show that the pipes supplied by the respondent were not used as sanitary fittings. The said certificate has been signed by the Executive Engineer on behalf of the' Chief Engineer of the department.
 In an appeal by certificate the appellant contended:
 (1) High Court should not have entertained the writ petition and should have allowed the assessee to avail of the remedies provided to him under the U.P. Sales Tax Act particularly when question of fact had to be determined.
 (2) On merits the conclusion of the High Court that hume pipes are nOt sanitary fit- tings is erroneous, Dismissing the appeal by certificate.
 Held:(1) The Court negatived the contention of the appellant that the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition and should have allowed the assessee to avail of the remedies provided to him under the U.P. Sales Tax Act. In the present case, whether the hume pipes manufactured and sold by the respondent were sanitary fir- ings was a question of law and since the entire material on the basis of which this question could be determined was placed before the Sales Tax Officer and had pointed in one and only one direction, namely, that the hume pipes were not sanitary fittings and there was nothing to show otherwise, the High Court was justified in entertaining the writ petition. There is no rule of law that the High Court should not entertain a writ petition where an alternative remedy is available to a party. It is always a matter of discretion and if the discretion has not been exercised by the High Court unreasonably or perversely, it is the settled practice of this Court not to interfere with the exercise of discretion by the High Court. In these circumstances this Court would not be justified in the interest of justice to interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution to quash the order of the High Court merely on that ground after having found that the order was legally correct. [124 B-E] (2) It is well-settled that in construcing the articles used for business purposes the terms must be interpreted in a purely commercial sense. [123 B-C] 121 Ramavatar Budhaiprasad etc. v. Assistant Sales Tax Officer, Akola [1961] INSC 98; (1962) 1 SCR 279, 282, followed.
 The King v. Planters Nut and Chocolate Company Ltd., (1951) Canada L.R.. Ex. Court 122. 126 approved.
 So construed by sanitary fittings one only understands such pipes or materials as are used in lavatories, urinals or bath rooms of private houses or public buildings. In the present case there was absolutely no material before the Sales Tax Officer to show that any of the hume pipes manu- factured and sold by the respondent were meant for use in lavatories. urinals or bath rooms and. in fact. the material was used entirely the other way. the Sales Tax Officer was not at all justified in holding that they were sanitary fittings [123 F-H] (3) The Sales Tax Officer does not appear to have ap- plied his mind at all to the reasons as to how and why hume pipes could be treated as sanitary fittings. The re- spondent had filed an application before the Sales Tax Officer wherein he had clearly alleged substantial facts showing that the hume pipes could never be used as sanitary fittings; that it is only the G.I.P. Pipes or other kinds of pipes which are used in lavatories, urinals and bath rooms which could be termed as sanitary fittings. The respondent had placed a large catena of materials in the shape of certificates from technical experts, engineers and highly reputed dealers in sanitary fittings that hume pipes are never used as sanitary fittings. Even where a hume pipe is used for carrying the escrated material from the Commode to the Sceptic tank that may be treated as sanitary fittings.
 The appellant in his counter affidavit before the High Court did not controvert any of the facts mentioned by the re- spondent, The State produced no material to controvert the facts. [122 D-G--123A] (4) The Court observed that if at any time the material produced before the Sales Tax Authorities establishes that in a given case hume pipes were meant to be used in the bath rooms, urinals and lavatories etc., then the notifica- tion of the Government would be attracted.
