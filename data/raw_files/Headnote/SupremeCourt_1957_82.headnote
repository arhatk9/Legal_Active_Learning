 The appellant, who used to carry on the business of conduct- ing prize competitions, was prosecuted on a charge under S.
 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The case against him was that though he found that his competitions did not attract a sufficiently large number of competitors to yield the guaranteed prize money, he advertised the competition in question and collected a large amount by way of entry fees with a dishonest intention, and did not utilize any part of the collected amount towards payment of the prizes offered.
 The Magistrate found that there was no evidence that the accused had used any part of the entry fees collected in any of the competitions for his own use but that, on the other hand, in order to meet the heavy demands of the prize winners in respect of the previous competitions, the accused had spent not only the amounts collected by him but also a large amount of money of his own capital. He accordingly came to the conclusion that though the accused had been utterly reckless and irresponsible in his conduct of the competitions and thereby caused loss to certain persons, he had not been guilty of any fraudulent or dishonest conduct and so could not impute any criminal liability to him. The High Court agreed with the Magistrate in acquitting the appellant of the charge under s. 420 of the Indian Penal Code but held that, though the. appellant did not have any dishonest intention in the initial stages, there was no justification for not having disbursed the amount of money collected in respect of the competition in question Prorate amongst the declared prize winners, and convicted him of misappropriation under S. 403, Indian Penal Code. On appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended for the appellant that (1) the High Court was not authorized by S. 423(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to convert an order of acquittal into an order of conviction in respect of an offence other than that for which the accused was tried by the trial Court, and (2) on the facts and circumstances of the case no offence under s . 403, Indian Penal Code, had been made out.
 94 740 Held: (1) that under S. 423(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the High Court has, in an appeal from an order of acquittal, the power to reverse the order and find the accused guilty of the offence disclosed by the evidence.
 (2) that in view of the fact that there was no express pro- vision in the rules and conditions of the competition in question that the money collected by way of entry fees should be reserved for payment to the prize winners in that very competition, the appellant could not be held guilty of misappropriation under S. 403 of the Indian Penal Code.
