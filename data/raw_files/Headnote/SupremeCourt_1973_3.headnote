 The respondent company is a registered dealer under the Central Sales Tax Act 1956 and deals mainly with vegetable products. It was granted the registration certificate under the Central Sales Tax (Registration and Turnover) Rules, 1957. In 1958, the respondent, applied to the Sales Tax Officer for amendment of the Registration Certificate so as to include Tin-plates or Tin-sheets under Sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the Act on the ground that those goods were used by the respondent for packing its vegetable products for sale.
 The application was rejected by the Sales Tax Officer on the ground that the goods in question were "Declared Goods" and therefore, their purchase on the strength of registration certificate could be allowed only if they were to be resold in the form in which they had been purchased A revision petition against the said order was dismissed by the Commissioner of Sales Tax who held that, the goods in question were not containers and that "Tin Plates", or "Tin Sheets" did not constitute packing material. Further revision filed before the Chief Commissioner was dismissed.
 The respondent thereafter, filed an application for making a reference to the High Court, but it was rejected by the Chief Commissioner on the ground of limitation. The res- pondent, thereafter, moved the High Court for direction to the Chief Commissioner to refer the question of law to the High, Court. In addition, the respondent filed a petition under Art.226 and 227 of the Constitution for a direction to the appellants to decide the application for amendment of the Registration Certificate in accordance with law. The High Court allowed the writ petition and held that the words in See. 8(3) (c) of the Act were wide enough to cover the goods in question. On appeal to this Court, the appellant raised the following question The "Tin Sheets and Tin Plates" are not covered by clause (c) of Sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the Act, as those goods constitute neither "containers nor materials intended for being used for packing of goods for sale." Further as tin sheets and tin plates cannot he used by the respondent unless they. are converted into. containers, the respondents cannot invoke the benefit of S.8(3)(c), of the Act.
 Dismissing the appeal, HELD:(i) The materials referred to in Clause (c) of Sec.
 8(3) according to its plain language, should be such as are intended for packing of goods for sale. Once the intention of using the materials for packing of goods for sale is proved. the requirements of the Clause would be satisfied.
 The fact that tin sheet and tip plates have to be subjected by the respondent to the Process of cutting and moulding into tin containers would not take them out of the category of materials intended for being used for the packing of goods 'for sale. The cutting and moulding is essential for putting the tin sheets and tin plates into 212 shape with a view to adapt them for actual user. The process of cutting and moulding does not alter the nature of the materials intended for use in packing the goods for sale. It only facilitates the actual user for packing. [214 FG] (ii) Packing materials are necessary not only for solid articles, but also for those in liquid and semi-liquid form.
 In a society that produces foodstuffs and manufactured articles in one. locality and use them in another' a wrapping or container is necessary during storage, transport and sale. [215-B] Encyclopaedia of Britannica, Vol. 17 of 1968 Edn. p. 22 referred to.
 The functions of a package are (1) to contain a convenient sized unit or amount of a product; (2) to protect it in transit; (3) to aid its safe delivery to the consumer and (4) in some cases, to display the product or promote its sale, or to act as a dispenser of it. The packing industry has expanded to meet the demands for processed and preserved foods rather than seasonal crops and new materials are being used for containers. In the present case, as the tin-sheets and tin-plates purchased by the respondent were intended to be used for packing of vegetable products sold by the respondent, it is entitled to invoke the benefit of Clause (c) of S. 8(3).
