 The respondent, a permanent Head Constable in the U.P.
 Police Force, was appointed in 1961 as officiating Platoon Commander in the combined cadre of sub Inspector, Armed Police and Platoon Commander. In 1966, an adverse nary was made in his character roll and he was reverted to the substantive post of Head Constable in 1968. At the time of reversion he was one among a group of about 200 officers, most of whom were junior to him. The High Court quashed the order of reversion to the post of Head Constable.
 On the question whether the order of reversion was made in violation of Art. 311 of the Constitution or in violation of any right of the respondent under Art. 16 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD: An order of reversion is in its immediate effect bound always to be a reduction in rank. Even a reversion from a higher but temporary or officiating rank to a lower substantive rank is in a sense a reduction. But, such orders of reversion are not always reduction in rank within the meaning of Art. 311. If the officer is promoted substantively to a higher post or rank, he gets a right to that particular post or rank and if he is afterwards reverted to the lower post or rank which he held before, it is a "reduction In rank" in the technical sense in which the expression is used in art. 311. The real test in all such cases is to ascertain if the officer concerned has a right to the post from which he is reverted. It cannot be ordered except in compliance with the provisions of art. 311. If on the other hand, the officer concerned has no right to the post, he can be reverted without attracting the provisions of art 311. But even in this case, he cannot be reverted in a manner which will show conclusively that the intention was to punish him. The order itself may expressly state that the officer concerned is being reverted by way of punishment. In fact the order may in various other ways cast a stigma on the officer concerned. In all such cases, the order is to be taken as a punishment. Sometimes again, the order of reversion may bring upon the officer certain penal consequences like forfeiture of pay and allowances or loss of seniority in the subordinate rank or the stoppage or postponement of future chances of promotion in such cases also the Government servant must be regarded as having been punished and his reversion to the substantive rank must be treated as a reduction in rank. In such a case art. 311 will be attracted. [342H; 343A-D] In the instant case the order of reversion is not attended with any stigma. There is nothing to show that the respondent has lost his seniority in the substantive rank and there is no evidence to show that there has been any forfeiture of his pay or allowances or any loss in the seniority in the substantive rank. The mere fact that the respondent will be deprived of he post of Platoon Commander is not a penal consequence. Such deprivation is in the usual consequence of an order of reversion from the officiating post to Which an incumbent has no right to hold.
 In a case like this what is important to see is whether the order of reversion entails any penal consequences and not the motive behind the reversion. [345A-E] Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. The Union of India, [1958] S.C.R.

 But, the order was liable to be quashed on the ground of contrave nation o articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 The complaint that 200 head constables wht had taken training as Cadet Sub-Inspectors of Armed Police after the respondenand who were junior to him have still been allowed to retain their persent statu as Sub-Inspector and have not been reverted to their substantive post of Hea Constable must be sustained. No possible explanation for this extreme form of dis crmination has been shown. It is also clear that there was no administrative reason for this reversion.
 There was no suggestion that the post had been abo lished or that the respondent was, for administrative reasons, required to go bacl, to- his own post of Head Constable.
