 Since1940 taxis plying in the streets of Calcutta were required to be not below 22 H. P. and not above 30 H. P. and rule 179of the Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules as amended in 1944 fixed a minimum charge of one rupee for the first mile and 2 as. for every onc-sixth of each subsequent mile. in 1952 the Regional Transport Authority issued a notification inviting applications for permits to ply small taxis of not below 10 H. P. and not above 372 19 H. P. and a proviso was added to rule 179 that in the case of such small taxis the tariff shall be 8 as. for the first mile and 2 as for every quarter of each subsequent mile. The permit holders of the bigger taxis applied to the High Court under art. 226 of the Constitution for a writ restraining the Regional Transport Authority from giving effect to the notification and issuing permits to small taxis, on the ground that the notification infringed their fundamental rights guaranteed by art. 19(I)(g) and art. 14 of the Constitution :
 Held, (i) that the introduction of small taxis and the fixing of a lower tariff for them was based on a rational classification and there was no contravention of art. 14 of the Constitution; (ii) as the permit holders of bigger taxis were not prevented from carryIng on their occupation and to ply their taxis,there was no infringement of art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution,and a writ as prayed for against the Regional Transport Authoritycould not be granted.
 Article 19(1)(g) does not guarantee a monopoly to a particular individual or association to carry on any occupation and if other persons are also allowed to carry on the same occupation and an element of competition is introduced, that does not, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the authorities, amount to a violation of the fundamental right guaranteed under art. 19(1)(g).
