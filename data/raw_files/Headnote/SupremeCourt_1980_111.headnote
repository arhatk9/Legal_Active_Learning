 Fazlunbi, the appellant, married Khader Vali, the respondent, in 1966, and during their conjugal life, a son Khader Basha, was born to them. The respondent, husband, an additional accountant in the State Bank of India, drawing a salary of Rs. 1000/-, discarded the wife and the child, and the tormented woman talaqed out of the conjugal home, sought shelter in her parent's abode. Driven by destitution, she prayed for maintenance allowance for herself and her son under section 125 Cr. P.C. and the Magistrate granted payment of a monthly sum of Rs. 250/- to the wife and Rs.
 150/- to the child. The respondent husband challenged the award in the High Court where the unjustified neglect was upheld, but the quantum of maintenance of the child was reduced to Rs. 100/- per mensem.
 Thereafter, the respondent husband resorted to the unilateral technique of talaq and tendered the magnificent sum of Rs. 500/- by way of Mahar and Rs. 750/- towards maintenance for the period of iddat, hopeful thereby, of extricating himself from the obligation to maintain the appellant. The Additional First Class Magistrate vacated the grant of maintenance already granted on the score of divorce coupled with discharge of mahar and Iddat dues. This order was unsuccessfully challenged in the Sessions Court. The desperate appellant reached the High Court and invoked its jurisdiction under section 482 Crl. P.C. A Division Bench of that High Court, though the revision petitioner banked upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Bai Tahira's case [1978] INSC 199; [1979] 2 SCR 75 in her favour, distinguished that case and dismissed the petition. Hence the appellant-wife's appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. The conscience of social justice, the cornerstone of our Constitution will be violated and the soul of the scheme of Chapter IX of the Code, a secular safeguard of British India vintage against the outrage of jetsam women and flotsam children, will be defiled if judicial interpretation sabotages the true meaning and reduces a benign protection into a damp squib. [1131 E-F] 
 2. Precedents of the Supreme Court are not to be left on the shelves. Neither could they be brushed aside saying that precedents is an authority only "on its actual facts".
 Such devices are not permissible for the High Courts when decisions of the Supreme Court are cited before them not merely because of the jurisprudence of precedents, but because of the imperatives of Article 141. [1134 D-E] 1128 No Judge in India, except a larger Bench of the Supreme Court, without a departure from judicial discipline can whittle down, wish away or be unbound by the ratio in Bai Tahira's case, in which Section 127(3)(b) of Crl. P.C. was interpreted. The language used is unmistakable, the logic at play is irresistible, the conclusion reached is inescapable the application of the law as expanded there is an easy task. And yet, the Division Bench, by the fine art of skirting the real reasoning laid down "unlaw" in the face of the law in Bail Tahira which is hardly a service and surely a mischief, unintended by the Court may be, but embarrassing to the subordinate judiciary. There is no warrant whatever for the High Court to reduce to a husk a decision of this Court by its doctrinal gloss. [1132 C-E] (3) Crl. P.C. (Sections 125-127) is a secular code deliberately designed to protect destitute women, who are victims of neglect during marriage and after divorce. It is rooted in the State's responsibility for the welfare of the weaker sections of women and children and is not confined to members of one religion or region, but the whole community of womanhood. Secondly muslim law show its reverence for the wife in the institution of Mehar (dower). It is neither dowry nor price for marriage. [1138 C-E] 
 4. The quintessence of mehar whether it is prompt or deferred is clearly not a contemplated quantification of a sum of money in lieu of maintenance upon divorce. Indeed, dower focusses on marital happiness and is an incident of connubial joy. Divorce is farthest from the thought of the bride and the bridegroom when mehar is promised. Moreover, dower may be prompt and is payable during marriage and cannot, therefore, be a recompense for divorce too distant and unpleasant for the bride and bridegroom to envision on the nuptial bed. May be, some how the masculine obsession of jurisprudence linked up this promise or payment as a consolidated equivalent of maintenance after divorce. [1140 D-F] 
 5. The language of Section 127(3)(b) suggests that payment of the sum and the divorce should be essential parts of the same transaction so as to make one the consideration for the other. The payment of money contemplated by section 127(3) (b) should be so linked with the divorce as to become payable only in the event of the divorce. Mehar as understood in Mohammadan Law cannot, under any circumstances be considered as consideration for divorce or a payment made in lieu of loss of connubial relationship. Under s. 127(3) (b) of the Cr. P.C., an order for maintenance may be cancelled if the Magistrate is satisfied that the woman has been divorced by her husband and that she has received, whether before or after the said order, the whole of the sum which, under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties was payable on such divorce. Therefore, even by harmonising payments under personal and customary laws with the obligations under ss. 125 to 127 of the Cr. P.C., the conclusion is clear that the liquidated sum paid at the time of divorce must be a reasonable and not an illusory amount and will release the quondam husband from the continuing liability, only if the sum paid is realistically sufficient to maintain the ex-wife and salvage her from destitution which is the anathema of the law. This perspective of social justice alone does justice to the complex of provisions from s. 125 to s. 127 of the Criminal Procedure Code. [1140 F-H, 1141 A-C] 1129 Kunhi Moyin v.

 6. (i) Section 127(3)(b) has a setting, scheme and a purpose and no talaq of the purpose different from the sense is permissible in statutory construction. [1141 C-D] (ii) The payment of an amount, customary or other, contemplated by the measure must inset the intent of preventing destitution and providing a sum which is more or less the present worth of the monthly maintenance allowances the divorce may need until death or remarriage overtake her.
 The policy of the law abhors neglected wives and destitute divorcees and s. 127(3)(b) takes care to avoid double payment one under custom at the time of divorce and another under s. 125. [1141 D-E] (iii) Whatever the facts of a particular case, the Code, by enacting ss. 125 to 127, charges the court with the humane obligation of enforcing maintenance or its just equivalent to ill-used wives and castaway ex-wives, only if the woman has received voluntarily a sum, at the time of divorce, sufficient to keep her going according to the circumstances of the parties. [1141 E-F] (iv) Neither personal law nor other salvationary plea will hold against the policy of public law pervading s.
 127(3) (b) as much as it does s. 125. So a farthing is no substitute for a fortune nor naive consent equivalent to intelligent acceptance. [1141 F-G] (v) Here the mahar paid is Rs. 500/ and the income therefrom may will be Rs. 5/- a month, too ludicrous to mention as maintenance. The amount earlier awarded is the minimum. [1141 G-H]
