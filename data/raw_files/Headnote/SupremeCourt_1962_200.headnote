 The appellant along with eleven others was charged and tried for offences under ss. 147, 302 read with s.34 of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution alleged that these twelve persons formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and in prosecution of their common object committed the offence of rioting armed with deadly weapons assaulted the Chief Head Warder and Watchmen and some of the member in prosecution of the common object caused the death of the Chief Warder.
 Since the appellant was undergoing sentence of imprisonment for life there was a further charge under s.303 of the Indian Penal Code against him. The trial court convicted all the accused for the offences for which they were 332 charged and acting under s.303 sentenced the appellant to death.
 The apellant thereupon appealed to the High Court and the sentence of death imposed on him was also referred to the High Court. The High Court confirmed the sentence of death and dismissed the appeal. The present appeal was filed by way of special leave granted by this Court.
 The main contention in the appeal was that s.303 can apply only to a case where a person while undergoing imprisonment for life himself commits a murder and becomes liable to be convicted under s. 302 without recourse to constructive liability under s. 34.
 Held, that if two or more persons acting in concert in pursuance of a pre-arranged plan proceed to commit an offence s. 34 steps in and provides that for the act committed by one the other is liable in the same manner as if it had been done by him alone. That being the effect of the rule prescribed under s. 34 it is difficult to accept the argument that where a person has been convicted under section 302/34 it cannot be said that he has committed an offence of murder. The position would not be any different even if the appellant had been convicted under s.302/149.
 Section 303 would apply even in cases where a person undergoing sentence of imprisonment for life is convicted either under s. 302 read with s. 34 or under s. 302 read with s. 149.
