 A girl under 16 years was induced to go to a particular house from where she was threatened to go to the house of the appellant who 'forcibly took her to his fields,outside the village and committed rape on her. The appellant was convicted for offences, under ss. 366 and 376 I.P.C. The medical evidence showed that there was penetration but no marks of violence on the victim's person.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The gravamen of the offence was that the appellant forced the girl to go with him to the fields to commit rape on her and this constitutes abduction punishable under s. 362 and 366, I.P.C. There is no question of any kidnapping from lawful guardianship or the appellant taking or enticing her out of the keeping of her lawful guardian or later taking her away for illicit purpose from unlawful custody. [201A-E] State v. Gopichand, A.I.R. 1961 Bom. 282, held inapplicable.
 (2) Under s. 375, I.P.C. read with the Explanation, where a person on whom rape is committed is under 16 years of age, her consent is immaterial and penetration is sufficient to constitute the offence. In the present case, mere absence of marks of violence on the person of the victim is immaterial because, that would merely suggest want of voilent resistance on her part which is wholly inconsequential since she is under 16 years of age. [201G-R] (3) In cases of sexual offences the prosecutrix is not considered as an accomplice and her testimony is not equated with that of an accomplice in an offence. It is only as a rule of prudence that courts normally look for some corroboration of her testimony so as to satisfy their conscience that she is telling the truth and that the person accused of rape on her is not being falsely implicated.
 [202G-H] In the present case, the, testimony of the victim by it-self is impressive enough to render it safe for sustaining the appellant's conviction. Moreover, the rescue of the victim from the appellant's sugarcane field, her complaint soon thereafter to the prosecution witnesses about the abduction and the rape, the later recovery of some broken pieces of bangles from the scene of occurrence, and the medical evidence, fully corroborate testimoney.
