 The appellant is a member of the Indian Police Service. He joined the service in 1952 and was confirmed in 1953. In 1958 the appellant was promoted to officiate in the senior time-scale and was posted as Additional Superintendent of Police at Ferozepore, in the place of one Siasat Singh who was granted leave, and his pay was fixed at Rs. 600.00 per month. He earned an increment and his pay was raised to Rs.
 640.00 per month. In July 1958 he was served with a charge sheet and was called upon to submit his defence and he submitted his reply. Before the enquiry started he was reverted to his substantive rank of Asstt. Superintendent of Police by an order dated November 3, 1958. His reversion was not due to "the return of the permanent incumbent from leave or deputation" or for any administrative reason.Other officers junior to the appellant continued to officiate in the senior scale while he was reverted.
 The personal file of the appellant which was produced both before this Court and the High Court showed that the reason given by the respondent for the reversion of the appellant was that he was tried as Superintendent of Police and was found to be immature and was not true. The file also revealed a note made by the Senior Superintendent of Police on 6-10-58 to the effect that as the regular enquiry into the conduct of the appellant would take a long time it was advisable to revert him.
 The appellant filed before the High Court of Punjab a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India against the order of reversion. The High Court dismissed the petition. The present appealwas by way of special leave granted by this Court.
 It was contended that under the relevant rules governing the Indian Police Service, a member thereof was entitled as of right to be promoted to a post in the senior scale as and when a vacancy (except a vacancy in the promotion quota) arose therein and no one senior to him was available for that post, that -upon the facts and circumstances of the case the order of reversion was in effect a reduction in rank within the meaning of Art.
 599 311(2) of the Constitution and that inasmuch as he was not given an opportunity of showing cause against the said order there was a violation of Art. 311. Relying on the principle laid down in Purshottam Lai Dhingra v. Union of India, [1957] INSC 95; [1958] S.C.R. 828 the appellant alternatively contended that the order of reversion involved penal consequences and operated as a punishment.
 The respondent denied that the appellant had any right to be appointed to a vacancy to a senior scale as claimed by him since such appointment was not automatic and it involved a process of selection. This being the position the reversion order did not amount to a reduction in rank so as to attract the provision of Art. 311(2). As to the alternative contention of the appellant the respondent replied that since the order of reversion was made for the reason that the appellant was found to be unfit and immature to hold a senior post, it could not be said that his reversion amounted to a punishment.
 Held:(per K. Subba Rao, Raghubar Dayal and J. R. Mu- dholkar, JJ.) A consideration of the various rules would make it clear beyond doubt that a person in the junior time- scale of the service is as much a cadre officer as one holding a post in the senior time-scale or a post above the time-scale. The efficiency bar contained in r. 6(2) of the Pay Rules has no bearing on the appointment of a person whose increment has been barred to a post in the senior scale. The wording of this rule lends support to the conclusion that in the service what counts is the length of service of a member and not even whether he has or has not passed the departmental examination. Had it been the intention of the Government to bring in the element of selection in so far as promotion of Assistant Superintendents of Police to the posts of Superintendents of Police is concerned express provisions would have found place in the rules.
 The whole scheme of the rules indicates that a person in the junior scale of pay has a right to hold a post on the senior scale of pay subject to the availability of a post in the senior scale of pay and his seniority in the junior scale of pay. If a person holding a post in the senior scale, though in an officiating capacity, is found to be unfit to hold that post action will have to be taken against him as required by r. 5 of Discipline and Appeal Rules because his reversion to a post in the lower scale would amount to a reduction in rank within the meaning of Art. 311.
 From the facts and circumstances of the case it is found that the appellant has not only been reduced in rank but his promotion to the senior scale also has been withheld and this could be done only by holding a departmental enquiry.
 The appellant was reverted to facilitate the departmental enquiry against him and the order of the Government was therefore mala fide.
 600 Held : (per S. K. Das, Acting C.J. and N. Rajagopala Ayyan- gar J.) An officer in the junior scale has no right to go automatically into the senior scale. On the contrary the suitability of a cadre officer is a relevant consideration even in the matter of a temporary appointment. The Indian Police Service (Pay) Rules, 1954, which provides for two independent scales spread over a period of years, seem to indicate that an officer in the junior scale cannot claim such automatic promotion. The provision for an efficiency bar at the stage when the salary of a junior officer reaches Rs. 590.00 also leads to this conclusion. The expression "on appointment to a post on the senior time-scale" occurring in r. 4(2) and the provision in r. 8 which states that any member of the service appointed to hold a post specified in Schedule 11 shall be entitled, as long as he holds that post, to draw the pay indicated for that post also support this conclusion. Explanation (4) to r. 4 of the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955, shows clearly that a member of the service cannot claim the right to officiate in a higher post merely by reason of his seniority and even when he is officiating in a higher post he may be reverted after a trial in that post or for ad- ministrative reasons and such a reversion does not amount to 2 reduction in rank.
 When a person is reverted to his substantive rank, the ques- tion of penal consequences in the matter of forfeiture of pay or loss of seniority must be considered in the context of his substantive rank and not with reference to his officiating rank from which he is reverted for every reversion must necessarily mean that the pay will be reduced to the pay of the substantive rank.
 A matter of this kind has to be looked from the point of view of substance rather than of form. All the relevant factors should be taken into consideration and if on such a consideration the conclusion is that the reduction is by way of punishment involving penal consequences to the officer even though the Government has a right to pass the order of reduction the provisions of Art. 311 will be attracted and the officer must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposed action.
 On an examination of the facts and circumstances of the case it is found that the appellant was reverted by way of punishment but he was given no opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him.
 Therefore the order of reversion was in violation of Art.
 311 of the Constitution.
