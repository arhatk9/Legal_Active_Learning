 Under a search warrant issued under s. 132, Income Tax Act, 1961, the Income Tax Authorities seized certain documents and money from the respondent. The Police also registered a criminal case against him. Thereafter, the Income Tax Officer assessed him to tax and adjusted the money seized against the tax due. The respondent moved the High Court, and the High Court held that the search and seizure were illegal and directed the Revenue authorities to hand over the money and documents to the Police to enable them to proceed in accordance with law. The Police, however, dropped the proceedings (filed as untraced) against the respondent for want of evidence.
 The respondent then moved the Magistrate for return of the documents and the money, alleging that the Police had not filed any challan against him for a long time, while the Revenue Authorities applied for retaining them. The Magistrate directed their return to the Police. The order was confirmed by the Sessions Court. The High Court, in revision, set aside the order of the Sessions Court and remanded the matter to the Magistrate to decide whether the adjustment of the amount against tax was permissible and valid.
 Meanwhile, the respondent had appealed against the order of assessment and Appellate Assistant Commissioner stayed the recovery of the tax assessed.
 The Magistrate after remand held that the amount seized be retained by the Revenue in partial satisfaction of the rex due from the respondent, but the Additional Sessions Judge in revision directed the Income Tax Authorities to return the documents and money to the respondent.
 A writ petition filed by the Revenue challenging the order was dismissed by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: After the prosecution against the respondent was dropped for want of evidence, the authorities had no right to keep the money seized from him under any provision of law. There is also no question of its adjustment, because, there is no valid order of assessment and there is no demand for tax. In fact, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner finally held that there is no order of assessment and that there was no demand for income tax. The Revenue Authorities cannot indirectly keep the money on the plea that there will be a demand and that, therefore, they should be allowed to keep the money. There must be authority of law under which the money can be kept, but in this case there was no legal order to keep the money. [997-C-D]
