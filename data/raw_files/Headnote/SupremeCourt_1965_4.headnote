 The appellant was a teacher in a college, affiliated to the University of Saugar, and managed by the Governing Body established under cl. 3 of the 'College Code' which is an ordinance made under the provisions of the University of Saugar Act. The Principal of the College served the appellant a charge sheet and asked him to submit his explanation. The appellants denied all the charges and requested the particulars on which one of the charges was based. The appellant alleged that this was not supplied and the Governing Body terminated his services without holding any enquiry. Thereafter the appellant moved the High Court for a writ quashing the order of the Governing Body and for his reinstatement; his case was that the Governing Body had made the order of discharge in violation of the provisions of the 'College Code,. The High Court rejected the contention of the appellant on the groundthat the conditions of service of the appellant were governed not by the 'College Code' but by the contract made between the Governing Body and the appellant. The High Court also took the view that provisions of 'College Code were merely conditions prescribed for affiliation of Colleges and no legal rights were -created by the 'College Code' in favour of the teachers of the affiliated colleges as against the Governing Body. In appeal by special leave.
 HELD : That the view taken by the High Court was erroneous.
 The provisions of Ordinance 20, otherwise called the "College Code" have the force of law. It confers legal rights on the teachers of the affiliated colleges and it is not a correct proposition to say that the "College Code" merely regulates the legal relationship between the affiliated Colleges and University alone. The provisions of the " college Code" relating to the pay scale of teachers and their security of tenure properly fall within the statutory power of affiliation granted to the University under the Act.
