 In 1954 the lands in dispute were notified under the Indian Forests, Act, 1927. Later, in order to, acquire and include them in the adjoining Government forest, Government notified them under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
 Government also took action under s. 17(4) of the Act, dispensed with the proceedings under s. 5A, and issued the notification under s. 6. Thereafter proceedings were taken under ss. 9 and 1.1, but Government decided that it was not worthwhile to acquire the entire area and withdrew some of the lands from acquisition.
 The appellant moved the High, Court unsuccessfully, under Art. 226, for directions to award him compensation in respect of those lands also.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended that : (1) Since the Government had taken possession in 1954, Government became full owners of the lands when notifications were issued under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act; and (2) the lands bad been actually taken possession of by the Collector under s. 17(1) and Government became full owners when public notice was given under s. 9(1).
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) There was no satisfactory evidence to show that the Government had taken possession of the lands in 1954.
 Therefore, the High Court was justified in not pronouncing on the question in a petition under Art. 226.
 (2) (a) Under s. 17(1) the Collector cannot take possession unless Government directs him to do so. There is no material on record to show that Government had given any such direction, nor is there any material to show that the Collector had taken possession under s. 17(1). [196 G-H] Lt. Governor of Himachal Pradesh v. Avinash Sharma, [1970] INSC 116; [1971] 1 S.C.R. 413, explained and distinguished.
 (b) The expression 'whenever the appropriate Government so directs' in s. 17(1) refers to the taking of possession and not to the declaration of urgency. But even in cases of urgency, Government may not think it necessary to take immediate profession. Hence, it could not be said that on ,the expiry of 15 days from the publication of the notice under s. 9(1), the lands had vested in the Government.
