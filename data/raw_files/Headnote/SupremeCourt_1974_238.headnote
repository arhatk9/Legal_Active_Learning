 On April 9, 1974, in the exercise of powers conferred by section 3 (1) (a) (ii). of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, the District Magistrate, Patna, made an order directing that the petitioner, who is a student leader, be detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The order of detention served on him on April 13, 1974, contained seven grounds. The order was confirmed by the Governor of Bihar on May 28, 1974. The petitioner filed a writ Petition in the High Court at Patna under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the detention order on various grounds. The petition was dismissed by the High Court. This Court granted special leave to appeal from the judgment of the High Court. Rule was also issued in the Writ Petition filed by the petitioner under Article 32 of the Constitution.
 It was contended for the petitioner that the grounds of detention furnished to him are vague, that some of the allegations contained in the grounds are ,false and that the grounds bear no relevance to the object of detention, namely, the maintenance of public order.
 Setting aside the order of detention and making the Rule absolute.
 
HELD. (i) The grounds of detention do not furnish intrinsic aid to justify ,the conclusion that all of them are inter- related. Nor is there any material to ,come to the conclusion that the petitioner can be said to have had notice of such interplay of one ground on another. [737B] (ii) The first ground contains these particulars : (1) The petitioner. in his capacity as Secretary of All India Vidyarthi Parishad, attended a meeting of the Bihar Rajya Chatra Neta Sammelan held on 17th and 18th February, 1974, in the Patna University campus; (2) A decision was taken in those meetings :at the instance of the petitioner that a Gujarat type agitation should be started in Bihar; and (3) It was also decided in those meetings to resort to hunger strike and to gherao the office of the Bihar Chief Minister, the Patna District Magistrate and other officials. By the second ground the following particulars were furnished to the petitioner (1) A meeting of the Students Steering Com- mittee was held on March 1, 1974 under President-ship of Shri Laloo Prasad Yadav; (2) it was decided in that meeting to form a Sanchahalan Samiti for conducting the students agitation and (3) the petitioner readily agreed in that meeting to become a member of the Sanchalan Samiti. It is impossible by merely reading these particulars to decipher the connection between grounds 1 and 2. Grounds 1 and 2 must be read disjunctively, each one referring to a distinct episode. One is not a sequel to the other and the validity of the two grounds has to be determined independently on the merits of each. [737C-D] (iii)One of the allegations in ground no. 1 is that, in the meeting of tile Bihar Rajya Chatra Neta, Sammelan, it was decided at the instance of tile petitioner "to start a Gujarat type of agitation in Bihar." The reference obviously is to the recent happenings in Gujarat which culminated in the dissolution of the State Legislature and the introduction of the Presidents Rule. The Court may and ought to take judicial notice of well-known facts of con- temporary life. But it is very difficult to comprehend the true connotation of 733 the so-called Gujarat type of agitation. It may mean differently to different people and is, therefore, vague.
 The court will be treading on a dangerous ground if it attempted to interpret judicially the genesis of recent political events. The court cannot assume that the decision to start a 'Gujarat type of agitation' meant a clarion call to violence. If the charge be that the petitioner had preached violence, the grounds of detention must say so. If the petitioner was not apprised of what was truly alleged against him and if the accusation, when reasonably read. was unintelligible, he was deprived of an opportunity to make an effective representation against the detention order. [738E- G] (iv)The second ground is irrelevant. An order of detention passer under any law providing for preventive detention has to answer the test that there has to be a nexus between the acts of the detenu founding the order of detention and the purpose of detention. The purpose here is to prevent the petitioner from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The mere fact that the petitioner was instrumental in forming the Sanchalan Samiti for conducting the students agitation or that he readily agreed to become a member of that Samiti cannot justify the conclusion that these acts are calculated to disturb public order. Peaceful protests and the voicing of a contrary opinion are powerful wholesome weapons in the democratic re- pertoire. It is therefore unconstitutional to pick up a peaceful Protestant and to put him behind the prison bars.
