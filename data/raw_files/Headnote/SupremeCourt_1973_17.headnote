 The appellant filed a suit against the respondents for his sham in certain property and the decree in the suit recognised his right as a co-sharer along with the respondents. After the U. P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, came into force the appellant filed a suit for division of the holdings on the ground that all the plots were joint bhumidhari and that his share should be separated. The respondents contested the claim on the ground that they alone had bhumidhari rights in the properties. The trial court dismissed the suit. The first appellate court upheld the appellant's claim under s.,18(1)(a) of the Act and decreed the suit. In second appeal, the High Court called for a finding from the first appellate court and the first appellate court submitted its finding that the respondents word in exclusive possession of the khudkasht and sir plots in dispute. Accepting the finding, the High Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Under s. 18(1)(a) all lands in possession of, or held, or deemed to be held by an intermediary as sir, khudkasht or an intermediary's grove on 30th June, 1952, shall he deemed to be settled by the State Government with such intermediary. The said intermediary is entitled to take or retain possession as bhumidhar. In order to claim the rights under the clause it is necessary that the lands should be (a) in possession of an intermediary as Khudkasht or sir, or (b) held by an intermediary as khudkasht or sir, or (c) deemed to be held by an intermediary as Khudkasht or sir. Khudkasht means land other than sir cultivated by a landlord either by himself or by servants or by hired labour. [415D-F] (2) In law, the possession of one co-sharer is possession both on his behalf as well as on behalf of all the other co- sharers, unless ouster is pleaded and established. In this case, the finding is that the respondents had not raised the plea of ouster, and there is no indication in the Act or the U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939, that bhumidhari rights are not intended to be conferred on all the co-sharers or co- proprietors who are entitled to the properties, though only some of them may be in actual cultivation. [416A-C] (3) Even when one co-sharer is in possession of the land the other co-sharers must be considered to be in constructive possession of the land. The expression 'Possession' in s. 18(1)(a) takes in not only actual physical possession but also constructive possession that a person has in law. [416C-E] (4) Section 18(1)(a) takes in two other contingencies, namely, lands held as khudkasht or lands deemed to be held as khudkasht. Even assuming that in view of the finding submitted by the first appellate court that the respondents were in possession, and on that basis, the appellant could not be considered to be also in possession, nevertheless, the lands and could be considered to be held or deemed to be held by the appellant also. If the expression 'held' occurring in cl. (a) means 11-L796Sup.C.I./73 412 actual possession then the same meaning must be given to the same word occurring in (b) also. But, in the latter part of cl. (b) the Legislature has used the expression 'personal cultivation' with reference to Avadh, whereas it has not used any such expression in the first part of cl. (b).
 Therefore, the expression 'held' must have a meaning different from' personal cultivation;' and can only taken to connote the existence of a right or title in a person; and the appellant's right and title as holder of the lands had already been declared. It canalso be held that the lands can be considered to be 'deemed to beheld' by the appellant. The expression 'deemed to be held' has beenused by the Legislature to treat persons like the appellant bhumidharsby creating a fiction. [417A-D] Budhan Singh & Anr. v. Nabi Bux & Anr., [1969] INSC 193; [1970] 2 S..C.R. 10 followed.

 (5)It was not necessary for the appellant to file an appeal against the order of the High Court calling for a finding from the first appellate court. That order was passed at an intermediary stage and the appellant was justified in waiting for the final decision of the High Court.
