 The appellant company was formed with a view to taking over certain industrial undertakings from the Government of the erstwhile State of Travancore. Apart from the cash consideration for the said purchase the appellant agreed to pay to the Government a certain percentage of its net profits every year. In proceedings under the Indian Income- tax Act, 1922, for the assessment year 1958-59 the appellant claimed the amount so paid to be expenditure allowable under s. 10(2) (xv). The High Court in reference proceedings held against the appellant who thereupon came to this Court. It was urged on behalf of the appellant that the annual payment was in the nature of revenue expenditure because it was not related to any part of the purchase price of the assets; on the other hand the Government had undertaken certain obligations under the agreement and the payment was in lieu of these. On behalf of the respondent it was urged that the payment formed part of the consideration for the purchase.
 
HELD:(i) No single test of universal application can be discovered for- a solution of the question whether a particular expenditure is in the nature of capital expenditure or revenue expenditure. The name which the parties may give to the transaction which is the source of the receipt and the characterisation of the receipt by them are of little consequence. The court has to ascertain the true nature and character of the transaction from the covenants of the agreement tested in the light of surrounding circumstances. [427 D-E] (ii) The percentage of the net profits payable by the appellant company to the Government under the agreement was payable for an indefinite period without limitation; it was related to the annual profits which flowed from the trading activities of the company having- no relation to the capital value of the assets; it was -also not tied up in any way to any fixed sum a,-reed between the parties as part of the purchase price of the three Government undertakings. There was no reference to any capital sum in this part of the agreement. On the contrary the very nature of the payment excludes the idea that any connection with the capital sum was intended by the parties.
 It is true that the purchaser may buy a running concern and fix a certain price and the price may be payable in a lump sum or may be payable by instalments. The mere fact that the capital sum is payable by instalment specied over a certain length of time will not convert the nature of that payment from the capital expenditure into, a revenue expenditure, but the payment of instalments in such a case would always have some relationship to the actual price fixed for the sale of the particular undertaking. As there was no specific sum fixed in the present case as an addi- tional amount of price payable in addition to the-cash consideration and payable in instalments or by any particular method the annual payment 424 made to the Government could not be held to be in the nature of capital expenditure. It was revenue expenditure.[428A-C] Case-law referred to.
