 The appellant and the respondent were married in 1945. In 1947 the appellant went to her parental home. She never returned thereafter. In 1955, prior to the coming into force of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the respondent contracted a second marriage. After the Act came into force he filed a petition for judicial separation from the appellant, under s. 10 of the Act, on the ground of desertion. The trial court allowed the petition. This decision was affirmed by the first appellate court and the High Court. The concurrent findings of the trial court and the first appellate court which were not questioned before the High Court were : (i) that the wife had left for her parental home with the intention of permanently giving up her marital relation with the husband and not to return to the husband; (ii) that the wife left her matrimonial home without any reasonable cause and without the consent of the husband and with the intention of bringing cohabitation to an end; (iii) that the second marriage contracted by the husband did not have any such impact on the mind of the wife as to cause her to continue to live apart and to continue the desertion; and (iv) that during her stay at the matrimonial home she was looked after well and was not ill- treated. In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that (i) in view of the Explanation to section 10(1) (,a) it could not be said on the date on which the petition was filed that the wife had deserted the husband without reasonable cause, because, the latter had contracted a second marriage and as such that lead to be regarded as a "reasonable cause" for staying away from him;
 and (ii) because of the provisions contained in the Hindu Women's Right to Separate Residence and Maintenance Act, 1956, as well as the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, desertion could not be described as one without reasonable cause if the husband bad married again since that marriage afforded justifiable cause to the wife to live apart from the band. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) To constitute desertion there must be two elements present on the side of the deserting spouse, namely, the factum of physics separation and the animus deserendi, i.e., the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end, and. so far as the deserted spouse is concerned, the absence of consent and absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the intention. [661 A-C] In order that desertion might come to an end there must be conduct on the part of the deserted spouse which afford just and reasonable cause for the deserting spouse not to seek reconciliation, and, it is also of equal importance that the conduct of the deserted spouse should have had such an impact on the mind of the deserting spouse that in fact it causes the deserting spouse to live apart. [661 G] 658 In the present case, ordinarily, the fact that the respondent had contracted a second marriage would have furnished a just cause to the wife to desist from making any attempt at reconciliation or resuming cohabitation. But the finding of the courts, including the High Court, was that the second marriage of the husband did not have any such impact on the mind of the wife as to cause her to continue to live apart and continue the desertion. This together with the other findings would conclude the matter, because..
 it is quite clear that within the meaning of the Explanation to s. 101 ) (a) the desertion by the wife had been proved without reasonable cause and without the consent of the husband.

 Prabhawati[1956] INSC 59; , [1956] S.C.R. 838, referred to.
 (ii) The consideration that in case the husband remarries, the wife is entitled to separate residence and maintenance under the Hindu Married Women's Right to Separate Residence and Maintenance Act, 1956, or any other enactment could not be utilised as a reason for coming to the conclusion that the fact of remarriage of the husband must necessarily afford a reasonable cause for desertion. The object of the Hindu Marriage Act, being not only to amend but also to codify the law relating to marriage among Hindus unless in any other enactment there is a provision which abrogates any provision of the Act or repeals it expressly or by necessary implication the provisions of the Act alone will be applicable to matters dealt with or covered by the same.
 The Hindu Marriage Act and the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, provide different remedies to a wife whose husband has been guilty of desertion. Section 18 of that latter Act does not amend or abrogate the provisions of s. 10 of the former. [663 H, 665 B] Sirigiri Pullaiah v. Sirigiri Rushingamma, A.I.R. 1963 A.P.
 323; and A. Annomalai Muadaliar v. Perunaee Ammal & Ors., A.I.R. 1965 Mad. 139, held inapplicable.
