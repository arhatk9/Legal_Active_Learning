 After the appellant instituted a suit against the respondent claiming a money decree the parties entered into an agreement for reference of the disputes to arbitration. The agreement provided for the withdrawal of the suit and the suit was withdrawn on or about the same date as that of the -agreement. There were changes in the arbitrator, and also extensions of time, but no award was made. The appellant therefore applied to the Court for filing of the arbitration agreement, under s. 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, but the application was rejected on the ground that the section was not attracted.
 In the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : In the light of the other parts of s. 20, its heading, and the general scheme of the Act, the words "before the institution of any suit with respect to the subject matter of the agreement or any part of it" in the section, mean, "while no suit with respect to the subject matter of the agreement or any part of it is pending"; and not "where no suit has been instituted". Therefore, the section is attracted to an arbitration agreement entered into while no suit with respect to its subject matter is pending.
 L691 G-H; 692 H; 693 A-B] Since on a proper interpretation of the agreement in the present case the withdrawal of the suit was the essential condition, the agreement would become operative only upon its fulfilment. Thus the effective arbitration agreement came into existence when the suit was withdrawn and may properly be said to have been entered into while no suit with respect to its subject matter was pending. Therefore, the agreement could be filed under s. 20. [694 A-C]
