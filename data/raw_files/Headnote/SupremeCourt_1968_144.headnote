 The appellant was the successful candidate in the 1967 State Legislative Assembly Elections. The 21st January, 1967 was the date fixed for the scrutiny of nominations and the actual polling took place on 18th February, 1967. The election of the appellant was challenged on the ground that he was not qualified to be chosen to fill the seat as he was less than 25 years of age. The High Court set aside the election on the ground that the appellant's nomination paper should have been rejected under s.36(2) (a) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The evidence conclusively showed that the appellant was in fact born on 25th January, 1942, and not on 15th January, 1942 as contended by him. [280 C] (2)Under s. 36(12)(a) the nomination paper of a candidate is, to be rejected if he is not qualified under Art, 173 of the constitution on the date Axed for the scrutiny of nominations, that is. if he had not attained the age of 25 years on that date. Consequently, the nomination paper of the appellant was liable to be rejected under s. 36(2) (a).
 Since, by the improper acceptance of the appellant's nomination, the result of the election was materially affected, the election had to be declared void under s.
 100(1)(d)(1) of the Act. [281 H; 28 A-B]
