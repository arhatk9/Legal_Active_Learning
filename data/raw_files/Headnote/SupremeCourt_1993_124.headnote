 The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, came into force in the respondent-State on 17.2.1976. The appellant claimed exclusion of vacant land owned by her, from the ambit of 'urban land' on the ground that it was mainly used for the purpose of agriculture, as defined in Section 2(o) of the Act. The land in question was entered in the revenue or land records before the commencement of the Act as for the purpose of agriculture. At the time when the Act came into force there was no master plan for the city in which the appellant's land was situated. However, a master plan for the city was made on 24.2.1980, wherein the land in dispute was shown.
 The competent authority declared that the appellant had 19813.83 sq. mts. of vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit, but the District Judge reduced the area of the excess land to 6738.23 sq. mts. Against the order of the District Judge, both sides filed writ petitions. The High Court dismissed appellant's writ petition and partly allowed the writ petition of the State Government. It held that the appellant's land could not be treated as mainly used for the purpose of agriculture by virtue of Explanation (C) because it was shown in the master plan made on 24.2.1980.
 In the appeals before this Court the correctness of the High Court's view was challenged by the appellant and restoration of the District Judge's order was sought.
 296 Allowing the appeals, this Court, 
HELD:1.1. Explanation (C) in Section 2(o) of the Urban Land (Ceiling & Regulation) Act, 1976 means that if the land has been specified in the master plan existing at the time of commencement of the Act for a purpose other than agriculture, then the land should not be deemed to be mainly used for the purpose of agriculture by virtue of the Explanation and not if the land is specified in a master plan prepared after the commencement of the Act The plain language of Explanation (C) bears this construction and requires it to be so construed in order to harmonise it with the other provisions and scheme of the Act, eg. Sections 3 and 5. The master plan defined in Section 2(h) and referred in the definition of 'urban laud' in Section 2(o), including Explanation (C) therein, is a master plan prepared and in existence at the time of commencement of the Act when by virtue of Section 3 of the Act, rights of the holder of the land under the Act get 'crystallised and extinguish his right to hold any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit. The proceedings for determining the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit according to the machinery provisions in the Act is merely for quantification, and to effectuate the rights and liabilities which have crystallised at the time of commencement of the Act. Just as the holder of the land cannot by his subsequent actions reduce the area of the vacant land in excess of the celing limit, the authorities too cannot by any subsequent action increase the area of the excess vacant land by a similar action. [298G-H, 299A-C] 1.2.The construction made of these provisions by the High Court cannot, therefore, be accepted. Accordingly, the order passed by the District Judge determining the area of 6738.23 sq. mts. only as the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit is restored. [299D-E]
