 The 2nd respondent obtained a money decree against the 3rd respondent and in execution of that decree brought the suit property to sale and the appellant purchased it. Prior to the sale, however, there was a decree, in favour of the 1st respondent, for arrears of maintenance, and a charge in favour of the 1st respondent was declared over the proper- ties of the 3rd respondent, including the suit property.
 The 1st respondent therefore filed an application under 0.
 21, r. 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to set aside the sale. The Executing Court dismissed the application holding that she had failed to show any substantial injury.
 The order was set aside by the High Court on appeal. In the appeal to the Supreme Court, it was contended that the application should be dismissed as : (i) there was no allegation of substantial injury in the application, and (ii) in fact the 1st respondent had not suffered any substantial injury.
 HELD : The appeal should be allowed.
 While s. 5 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 defines "transfer of property" only as a transfer effected by act of parties inter vivos, s. 2(d) provides that save as provided by Chapter IV of the Act, the provisions of the Act are not deemed to affect transfers in execution of decrees. Since the positive provision in s. 2(d) prevails over s. 5, Chapter IV and s. 100 in that Chapter would apply to auction sales in execution of decrees. Section 100 provides that a charge shall not be enforced against any property in the hands of a person to whom the property has been transferred for consideration and without notice of the charge. The result would be that as a consequence of the material irregularity in not referring to the charge in favour of the 1st respondent in the proclamation of sale under 0. 21, r.
 66 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, the 1st respondent would not be able to enforce the charge against the suit property purchased by the appellant in auction sale. When injury is thus implicit in the irregularity it would be too technical to dismiss the application on the ground that there was no express averment of substantial injury as required by the proviso to 0. 21 r. 90(1) of the Code. But the application should however be dismissed, because the injury suffered by the 1st respondent was not in fact a substantial injury. There were other propertiesto the charge and they would be available to meet all her legitimateby way of maintenance. [731 C-D, G; 732 B;
