 The appellant was a cooperative society registered under the Bombay Cooperative Societies Act, 1925. During the assessment period November 1, 1960 to October 31, 1961 the Society received large quantity of cotton from its members and the same was sold by it either after ginning and pressing or without ginning and pressing. The Society was a registered dealer under the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959. The Sales Tax Officer accepted the return filed by the society and did not levy any purchase tax on it. However the Assistant Commissioner issued a notice under s. 57 of the Act on the basis that it had purchased cotton and cotton seeds from its members and these purchases were liable to purchase tax. The Tribunal, relying on bye-laws 37(7), 37(18), 37(19), 48, 49, 52, 53 and 55 of the Society, upheld the view of the Assistant Commissioner and dismissed the- Society's revision petition. It rejected the contention of the Society that it was functioning merely as the agent of its members. The High Court in reference also decided against the Society. In appeal to this Court by special leave.
 
HELD : In considering whether a transaction is a sale or not what the court has to consider is whether as a result of the transaction, the property in the goods passed to the assessee 'for a price and whether the assessee sold those goods as its own. [717 B-C] Being a producer's society as defined in s. 3(h) of the Cooperative Societies Act the appellant Society was evidently formed primarily with the object of selling the produce of the members as their collective produce. The preamble to the Act showed that two of the objectives intended to be achieved by the Act were to provide for self help by the members of the society and for mutual aid among them. The bye-laws of the Act must be examined in the background of the preamble to the Act as well as the definition of Producers' Society., So examined none of the bye-laws including those relied on by the Tribunals showed that the society had purchased either cotton or cotton seeds from its members. [717 E-H] From bye-law 2 it was clear that the object of the society was not to purchase or sell any cotton or cotton seeds on its own behalf. aauses (7), (14), (16) and 18 of bye-law 37 indicated that the Society was selling the produce of others and not its own goods. Bye-law 45(1) under which loans on interest could be advanced to the members against the security of the goods clearly showed that the goods were entrusted to the Society and not sold to it. The society could not advance money on the security of its own goods.
 If the transactions were sales in favour of them 715 Society then the amounts to be paid by the society would be purchase price. Such a payment cannot be made on the security of goods, nor can that payment carry any interest.
 [718 B- 720 A] Bye-law 48 refers to the goods of the members of the society and not to the goods of the Society. Because of that bye- law the members of the Society, who are bound by that bye- law must be deemed to have authorised the Society to pool their goods, grade them if necessary and sell them either after ginning or without ginning. That bye-law also prescribed the mode in which the price fetched should be distributed amongst the persons whose goods are sold. The society is the agent of all its members. Its principals are many. Because of the various bye-laws, the several principals must be deemed to have appointed a common agent- the So-ciety-for disposing of their goods in the manner most advantageous to them. To achieve that object they must be held to have empowered the Society to pool their goods, grade them if necessary, and sell them either after ginning or without ginning. Such an authority does not violate the laws of agency. A person can be an agent for more than one principal and if all his principals jointly authorise him to pool their goods and sell them and pay the sale price to them in the manner prescribed by them,. he does not cease to be an agent. [720 G-721 B] Accordingly the appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the High Court set aside.
