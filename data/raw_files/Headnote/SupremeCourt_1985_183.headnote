 The first respondent is a company incorporated on 30th June, 1969, which commenced its business in the name and style of Binny Limited on ant from Ist November, 1969. The appellants were formerly employed by Binny & Co. Ltd., and are now employed in the Finance, Trading ant Agency Division of the respondent Company. Messrs Binny & Co. Limited in which the appellants were formerly employed, was a well established British Company of a standing of more than 170 years with branch. all over India and had accumulated huge reserves and was able to acquire interest in various other companies namely, Messrs Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd., The Bangalore Woollen, Cotton ant Silk Mills Co. Ltd., Binny Engineering Works Ltd, Gange Transport and Trading Company Ltd., and Madura Company Private Limited. All these five companies were amalgamated in accordance with the scheme of amalgamation sanctioned by different High Courts with the respondent Company. The scheme of amalgamation made provisions for various matters. Clause 12 of the scheme provided that "all the employees of the amalgamating companies will become employees of the new company without interruption in service and on terms no less favourable to them." Clause 13 provided that "a separate 653 profit ant 1088 account would be prepared for each of the amalgamating companies for the financial year 1969." The High Court while sanctioning the scheme, included in paragraph 11 of the order "In the result, the scheme of amalgamation is sanctioned without prejudice to the rights of the employees of Binny and Company Limited in working but their existing rights under the aforesaid Acts (Payment of Bonus Act and Industrial Disputes Act) as against the w company, if they are 80 entitled." Till the year 1968, the employees of Binny & Co.
 Limited namely, the appellants, had been getting the maximum bonus of 20 per cent of their gross salary every year in view of the huge profits earned by the said company.
 However, in the financial year 1969, the respondent Company declared and paid the minimum bonus of four per cent of the gross salary to the appellants alongwith other employees of the respondent company, who were formerly the employees of the remaining five amalgamating companies on the basis of a consolidated profit and loss account of the respondent company for the said year. The appellants objected to this ant raised a claim that they were entitled to receive bonus at 20% of their gross salary on the basis of the separate profit and 1088 account for the company formerly known as Binny & Company Limited prepared under clause 13 of the scheme of amalgamation and which showed a profit of Rs.26,01,272 during the financial year 1969 in addition to a further sum of more than Rs.. 10 Lakhs lying to the credit of the appellants as on 31st December, 1968. This claim was referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Madras by a reference order dated l9th May, 1971, directing the question of fixation of the quantum of bonus for the year 1969 for adjudication. The Tribunal considered the evidence before it ant also referred to the relevant provisions of the law governing the question and came to the conclusion that no separate balance sheet was prepared for this company and the quantification of the bonus payable and to be made on the consolidated surplus available taking into account the balance sheet of the amalgamating companies under section 3 of the payment of the Bonus Act. Hence the appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. It is trite law that in matters of welfare legislation, especially involving labour, the terms of contracts ant the provisions of law should be liberally construed in favour of the week. [658 H, 659 A] 654 
 2.1 Where an amalgamating unit can prepare a balance sheet, when a trial balance sheet and profit and loss account are avail able, omission to do 80 deliberately and without any valid reason would amount to denial of the benefit of the proviso to section 3 of the Payment of Bonus Act to the employees of such as amalgamating unit. [659 F-G] 
 2.2 When evidence and facts made available before the Court show that the claim of the employees (on the strength of profit and loss account and trial balance-sheet) is justifiable, it would be not only improper but unjust for the Courts and Tribunals to deny to themselves the jurisdiction to direct a company to prepare a balance-sheet in terms of the profit and 1088 account and the trial balance-sheet. To say that Tribunals or Court cannot even in such exceptional situations direct the employer company to prepare the balance-sheet would create undesirable results, adverse to the employees. [659 B-C, F-G] 
 3.1 Section 3 is an enabling provision in favour of the employers. When an establishment consists of different departments, undertakings or branches, all such departments, under takings or branches shall be treated as part of the same establishment for the purpose of computation of bonus under the Act. This means that the employees will be entitled to bonus on the basis of the surplus available from all the units put together. The proviso speaks of separate balance-sheet and profit and 1088 account being prepared and maintained for any accounting year in respect of one of the units of the whole undertaking. In such cases, the computation of allocable surplus for the payment of bonus should be on the basis of such separate profit and loss account and balance-sheet thus prepared and the employees will be entitled to claim bonus on this basis. The claim of the employees on this basis can be defeated only if this separate unit was treated as part of the establishment for the computation of bonus immediately before commencement of the accounting year in question. In this case the company has not put forward a plea that for the previous year, Binny and Company Ltd., was treated as part of the respondent company for the purpose of computation of bonus. The only plea put forward is that no separate balance- sheet was prepared for this unit. [659 H, 660 A-D)] 
 3.2 The mere ommission to prepare a separate balance sheet for one of the amalgamating units will not by itself help the company to deny bonus to the employees of such a unit. When profit and loss account and trial balance-sheet are prepared there should be / difficulty in preparing the regular balance sheet. [660 DEL 655
