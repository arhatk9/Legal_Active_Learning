 The appellant was examined as a forensic expert in a sessions trial. He claimed to hold a diploma in criminology which he produced before the Sessions Judge on being asked to do so. On the basis of the appellant's testimony the accused were acquitted. On the allegation that the diploma produced by the appellant was a forged one the prosecution applied to the Sessions Judge under s. 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for prosecution of the appellant under s.
 193 of the Indian Penal code. The application was rejected by the Sessions Judge. Subsequently on a report being lodged with the police the appellant was charge-sheeted for offences under ss, 465 and 471 of the Penal Code. The appellant objected it his trial for these offences that he could not be legally prosecuted as the facts disclosed offences under ss. 193 and 196 of the Indian penal code and not under ss. 465 and 471 with which he was charged. He alleged that the prosecution was attempting to evade the provisions of s. 195 of he Code of Criminal Procedure. The trial court having overruled the appellant's objections, he went in revision to the High Court and having failed there as well, he appealed to this Court by special leave.
 
HELD : (i) The evidence did not disclose any offences under ss. 465 and 471, but rather offences under s. 193 and 196 I.P.C. The distinction between sections 465 and 471 on the one hand and 193 and 196 on the other is that the gist of the offence in the first group is the making of a false document and the gist of the offences in the second group is the procuring of false circumstances or the making of a document containing a false statement so that a judicial officer may form a wrong opinion in a judicial proceeding on the faith of the false evidence. Another important difference is that whereas s. 471 requires a user to be either fraudulent, dishonest or both, s. 196 is satisfied if the user is corrupt. it was not alleged that the appellant himself forged the diploma and therefore S. 465 was not -attracted. For s. 471 it is necessary that the forged document is 'used' by the accused 'dishonestly' and 'fraudulently'. Even if production of the 'document at the be best of the court can amount to 'using' the document, it could not be said to have been used 'dishonestly' as the appellant did not intend to cause wrongful gain to himself or wrongful loss to another. Nor could he be said to have used it 'fraudulently' within the meaning, of s. 25 of the Penal Code, that is to say, with "intent to defraud", inasmuch as his intention in producing the certificate was not to cause any one to act to his disadvantage. since he only complied with the order of the Court. [499 H-500 D; 503 B-E] 494 The prosecution of the appellant for offences under ss.
 465/471 I.P.C. could not therefore be allowed to continue.

 (ii) If the appellant gave false evidence in court or if he fabricated false evidence the offence under s. 193 was clearly committed. Again when he used his diploma as genuine his conduct was 'corrupt' within the meaning of that word as used in s. 196. That section includes conduct which though neither fraudulent nor dishonest is otherwise blame- worthy or improper. [501 A-B; 500 H] Emperor v. Rana Nana, I.L.R. 46 Bom. 317 and Bobkhranjan Gupta v. The King, I.L.R. [1949] 2 Cal, 440, referred to.
 The evidence thus disclosed that the appellant committed offences under ss. 193 and 196 of the Penal Code. For prosecution under these sections, the sanction of the Court in writing was necessary. In the lessor offences under ss.
 465 and 471 no such sanction was necessary. It is obvious that the lesser offences were chosen to bypass the Sessions Judge who had earlier decided that the appellant should not be prosecuted for perjury. Such a device is not to be commended.
