 for offences in connection with the death of one Nanhey Lal and injuries to his son, Raj Kishore.

The learned Sessions Judge acquitted the appellants upon which Ram Narain, a brother of the deceased Nanhey Lal, filed a revision application in the High Court of Allahabad under section 439, Code of Criminal Procedure.
 challenging the order of acquittal. The High Court allowed the revision application, set aside the order of acquittal and directed that the appellants be retried by the Sessions Court. This appeal by special leave has been preferred against the judgment of the High Court ordering retrial.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The revisional jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be invoked merely because the lower court has taken a wrong view of the law or misappreciated the evidence on record.

Stale of Orissa etc. [1969] INSC 182; [1970] 1 S.C.R. 880 referred to While applying the principles laid down by this Court in this respect, the High Court has fallen precisely into the error which was corrected by this Court in these decisions The error which the High Court committed is that in the first place it blamed the accused for not demanding an identification parade, secondly it held by examining a few aspects of the evidence that the accused were previously known to the eye-witnesses and thirdly it assumed wrongly that the conclusion of the Sessions Court that Nanhey Lal had made a dying declaration was based on inadmissible evidence. The Sessions Court considered the various circumstances and came to the conclusion that Nanhey Lal had made a dying declaration. That conclusion may be wrong but that cannot justify setting aside the order of acquittal and directing a retrial of the appellants. The dominant justification of the order of acquittal recorded by the Sessions Court is the view it took of the evidence of the eye-witnesses. If that evidence was unacceptable, there were no circumstances in the case on which the appellants could be convicted. [748B-C] The High Court has thus transgressed the narrow limits of its revisional jurisdiction under section 439(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The judgment of the Sessions Court did not suffer from any manifest illegality and the interests of justice did not require the High Court to interfere with the order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Court. Any fair assessment of the evidence of the eye- witnesses would show that the acquittal of the appellants led to no Miscarriage of justice. [748D]
