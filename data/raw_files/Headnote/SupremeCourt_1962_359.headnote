 In exercise of the powers under s. 42 of the Madras Port Trust Act, 1905, the Trustees of the Port of Mardas, the appellants, made amendments to the Madras Port Trust Scale of Rates in 1958. By the amendment, Scale 'E' was added under Ch. V and it was to come into force from March 1, 1958. The scale laid down charges to be paid by Masters, Owners or Agents of vessels in respect of Port Trust labour requisitioned and supplied but not fully or properly utilised. These charges were to be on account of the labour of the Port Trust rendered idle on account of some lapse on the part of the ship owners or on account of extra payment to labour for the simultaneous working of more than one hook at the vessel's hatch. The labour requisition Form to be submitted by the steamer-agents was also modified and the new form contained an undertaking on the part of the steamer-agents for the payment of the charges laid down in Port Trust's scale of rates from time to time in respect of labour rendered idle or not properly utilised and also for working more than one hook simultaneously at the hatch. The respondents, the steameragents, filed petitions before the High Court of Madras under I' . 226 of the Constitution of India, praying for a direction to the Port Trust not to enforce these rates and not to require the filling in of the new form, on the grounds, inter alia, (1) that the ship- owners and the steamer-agents could not be made liable for charges for short labour employed in the receiving or removal of cargo and such charges must be borne by the consignee, (2) the Port Trust had power to impose and recover rates only or services rendered and that they had no right to impose charges by way of compensation for default or to collect 916 charges from Masters, Owners or Agents of vessels in respect of operations not properly falling under the head of discharge of cargo from the vessel, (3) the compulsion imposed on steamer agents in the matter of the scale 'E' rates and in respect of the signing of the requisition for shore labour was outside the authority conferred by law and was illegal, and (4) such imposition whether as charges for services or as compensation for default of steamer agents was an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on business as steamer-agents and was inoperative in law.
 Held : (1) The object behind the scale 'E' rates was to expedite the discharge of the cargo at the quay and thus to enable a quantity of cargo to be discharged 'quickly. The services rendered by the Port Trust were therefore services to the ship and, consequently, charges for them could be validity realised from the steamer-agents.
 (2) The Madras Port Trust Act, 1905, did not contain any provision which would constitute the Port Trust an agent of the consignee for the purpose of the taking delivery of the goods and the expression "receiving" in cl. (b) of sub-s.
 (1) of s. 39 of the Act did not mean receiving the goods on behalf of the consignee.
 (3) Under ss. 39 and 40 the Port Trust took charge of the goods on behalf of the ship-owner and not on behalf of the consignee, and whatever services it performed at the time of the landing of the goods or on their removal thereafter, were services rendered to the ship.
 (4) The impugned charges were rightly levied by scale `F' on the Master, Owner or Agent of the vessels and that the Port Trust could validly insist on the steamer-agent requisitioning the shorc-labour to express., an undertaking in the form for requisitioning labour that lie would pay the charges laid down in the Port Trust's scale of rates from time to time in respect of labour rendered idle or not properly utilised and also for working more than one hook simultaneously at a vessel's hatch.
