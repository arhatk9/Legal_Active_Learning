 The petitioners/appellants were holders of Upper Subordinate or Overseers. Civil Engineering certificates of Osmania Engineering College and they were all originally recruited to the cadre of Sub-Overseers in the Hyderabad Service of Engineers in the erstwhile State of Hyderabad, and with the exception of: one, they were promoted as Supervisors prior to 1st November 1956, when the reorganisation of States took place under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Now on the reorganisation of the State of Andhra Pradesh. the posts of Supervisors in the erstwhile State of Hyderabad were equated with the posts of Junior Engineers/Supervisors in the State of Andhra Pradesh in accordance with the principles for equation of posts laid down at the Conference of Chief Secretaries of various States held on 30th April and 1st May, 1956. Certain criteria were laid down at this Conference for fixation of inter se seniority of officers holding equivalent posts.
 The Sub-Engineers from the erstwhile State of Hyderabad were promoted as Assistant Engineers with effect from 31st October, 1956, afternoons and they came to be allotted to the State of Andhra Pradesh as Assistant Engineers. Though the Andhra Rules continued to govern the Engineering Service in the State of Andhra Pradesh by Way of exception. the Government of Andhra Pradesh, in consultation with the officer deputed by the Government of India to advise on problems relating to integration of services. issued an order dated 7th April, 1960. directing that all employees of the erstwhile State of Hyderabad would be governed by the Hyderabad Rules for promotion after, 1st November, 1956, to posts one stage above those held by them immediately prior to 1st November, 1956. It was, however, made 'clear in this order that subsequent promotions after one stage promotion would be governed by the Andhra Rules or the Rules made by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The State Board of Technical Education, a high-powered body comprising of administrators, educationists and technical experts, at its meeting held on 1st June,. 1962, agreed with the view expressed by the Special Committee that the US or OCE certificates of the Osmania Engineering College could not be equated with LCE, or IME or LEE diplomas. The Government of Andhra Pradesh then, reconsidered the question in the light of the opinion expressed by the Special Committee and the State Board of Technical Education and took the view that the contention of the non-graduate, Supervisors from the erstwhile State of Hyderabad was not tenable. The Central Government affirmed the decision of the Government of Andhra Pradesh after giving due consideration to the representations of these non-graduate supervisors an the basis of the recommendations of the Advisory Board.
 Meanwhile, on 22nd February 1967, the Andhra Pradesh Engineering Rules,. 1966, were made by the Governor of Andhra Pradesh in exercise of the powers conferred under the Proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. There was a substantial change made by the Andhra Pradesh Rules in the mode of recruitment to the posts of Assistant Engineers. By the new clause 2(c)(2) substituted in the place of the old clause on 12th January, 1968, the ratio of 450 promotion between graduate Supervisors and non-graduate Supervisors was altered and instead of two out of three vacancies being filled by graduate Supervisors, three cut of four vacancies were to be filled by graduate Supervisors, with the result that the cyclic order of rotation now consisted of twenty-four instead of eighteen vacancies. The appellants, thereupon preferred writ petitions in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. challenging the validity of the orders dated 3rd October, 1960, and 14th February, 1963 as also of the Andhra Pradesh Rules on various legal and constitutional grounds. The Full Bench ,of the High Court rejected the contentions of the, appellants and dismissed the writ petitions. After obtaining certificates, they preferred these appeals. In W.P. No. 218 of 1970 filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners hold LCE diplomas. Some of them were directly recruited as Supervisors in the State of Andhra. prior to 1st November. 1956. and others were directly recruited as Supervisors in the State of Andhra Pradesh subsequent to ,hat date. Their grievance was that the Andhra Pradesh Rules adversely affected them and others directly recruited as non-graduate Supervisors.
 The petitioners/appellants contended that (i) the decision of the Government of Andhra Pradesh (which was confirmed by the Government of India) treating US and OCE certificates of the Osmania Engineering College as inferior to US and LCE diplomas of the College of Engineering, Guindy and LCE, LME or LEE, diplomas of any other recognised institution and equating them with US or OCE certificates of the College of Engineering. Guindy, was erroneous and should be set aside;
 (ii) The non-graduate Supervisors from the erstwhile Hyderabad State who were, prior to 1st November, 1956, entitled to have 50% ,of the vacancies in the posts of Assistant Engineers available to them for promotion, are now entitled to have only one out of twenty-four vacancies in 'the posts of Assistant Engineers available to them for promotion. In as much as the Andhra and Andhra Pradesh Rules varied to their disadvantage the conditions of service applicable to them immediately prior to 1st November. 1956.
 they were ineffectual and void by reason of contravention of the mandatory requirement of the proviso to Sec. 115, sub- section (7) of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956; (iii) The promotions made from and after 1st November. 1956. upto 22nd February 1967, should be reviewed on the basis that the Hyderabad Rules governed the promotion of non-graduate Supervisors from the erstwhile Hyderabad State, because the promotion from the posts of Supervisors to the posts of Assistant Engineers from and after 1st November 1966, being one stage promotion, the promotion was governed by the Hyderabad Rules unto 22nd February, 1967, when they were superseded by the Andhra Pradesh Rules: and (iv) The Andhra Pradesh Rules in so far as they discriminate between graduate Supervisors and non-graduate Supervisors by fixing initially the ratio ,of three to one between graduate and non-graduate Supervisors for the purpose of promotion to the posts of Assistant Engineers are violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and hence void.
 Dismissing the appeals and the writ petitions, 
HELD : (1) The question in regard to equivalence of educational qualifications is a technical question based, on proper assessment and evaluation of the relevant. academic standards and practical attainments of such qualifications.
 It is only where the decision of the Government is shown to be based oft extraneous or irrelevant considerations or actuated by mala fides or irrational and perverse ,or manifestly wrong that the Court would reach out its lethal arm and strike down the decision of the Government. It cannot be said in the present case that the view taken by the Government of Andhra Pradesh suffered from any of these infirmities. Nothing could be alleged on behalf of the petitioners appellants against those constituting the High- powered expert body. It may also be noted that even in the erstwhile State of Hyderabad itself, US and OCE certificates of Osmania, Engineering College were not. treated on a par with LCE, LME or LEE diplomas. [466B-E] (ii)The Limitation imposed by the proviso to sub-section (7) of Section 115 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, is that the State cannot vary the conditions of service applicable immediately before 1st November,, 1956, to the disadvantage of persons allotted to serve in connection with the affairs of the State, except with the previous approval of the Central Government. Now the only right in regard to promotion which the condition of service immediately 451 prior to 1st November, 1956, gave the non-graduate Supervisors from the erstwhile Hyderabad State was the right to be considered for promotion to 50% of the posts of Sub- Engineers. A rule which confers a right of actual promotion or a right to be considered for promotion is a rule prescribing a condition of service. This proposition can no longer be disputed in view of several pronouncements of this Court. [468C-E; H] Mohammad Bhakar v. Krishna Reddy, 1970 Service law Reporter 768, State of Mysore v. G. B. Purohit, C.A. No. 2281 of 1965, decided on 25th January 1967. and Ramchandra Shankar Deodhar & Ors. v. The State of Maharashtra, W.P. No. 299 of 1969, decided on 12th November, 1973, referred to and relied on.
 Now. here in the present case, all that happened as a result of the application of the Andhra Rules and the enactment of the Andhra Pradesh Rules was that the number of posts of Assistant Engineers available to non-graduate Supervisors from the erstwhile Hyderabad State for promotion, was reduced from 50% to 33-1/3%. then to one in eighteen and ultimately to one in twenty four. The right to be considered for promotion was not affected but the chances of promotion were severely reduced. This did not constitute variation in tile condition of service applicable immediately prior to 1st November, 1956, and the proviso to Section 115, sub-section (7) was not attracted. [469D] Even if the application of the Andhra Rules and the enactment of Andhra Pradesh Rules constituted variation in the condition of service in regard to promotion applicable immediately prior to 1st Nov. 1956. to the disadvantage: of non-graduate Supervisors from the erstwhile Hyderabad State, there was previous approval of the Central Government to such variation and the requirement of the proviso to section 115, sub-section (7) was satisfied. It will be evident from the memorandum dated 11th May, 1957, and particularly para- graph 6 read with paragraph 3 that. so far as departmental promotion is concerned, the Central Government-told the State Governments that they might, if they so desire, change the conditions of service and for this purpose they might assume the previous approval of the Central Govt. as required by the proviso to Sec. 115 sub-section (7). The conditions of service specifically dealt with in paragraph 3 of the 'memorandum included those relating to departmental promotion and under paragraph 6 of the memorandum, the Central Government gave its previous approval to any alteration which the State might wish to make in the conditions of service relating to departmental promotion, because in the opinion of the Central Government, they did- not need to be protected. The argument against such construction is not valid. In the setting in which the proviso to section 115(7) is placed. the expression "previous approval" would include general approval to the variation in the conditions of service within certain limits, indicated by the Union Government.

 (ii)It can hardly be disputed that tinder the Hyderabad Rules, the Post on,-- stage above that of Supervision was the post of Sub-Engineer and it was only from the post Sub- Engineer that promotion lay to the post of Assistant Engineer. Now the cadre of Sub-Engineers having been abolished by the Government of Andhra Pradesh from 1st November. 1956 with a view to absorb and' assimilate officers holding the post of Sub-Engineer immediately prior to 1st November 1956, in the Engineering service of the State of Andhra Pradesh, the Government promoted these officers as Assistant Engineers and they were placed en bloc below the Assistant Engineers of the Telangana and Andhra regions in seniority. But this does not mean that the post of Sub-Engineer was equaled with that of Assistant Engineer in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The post of Sub-Engineer was abolished and there was no question of equating it with the post of Assistant Engineer. The post of Assistant Engineer was, therefore, not a post of one stage promotion from the post of Supervisor. Contention based on rule 42(h)(i) of the Andhra Pradesh Rules has-also to be rejected, because, in the first place, the Hyderabad Rules did not provide for promotion directly from the post of Supervisor to the post of Assistant 452 Engineer, and secondly, under the Hyderabad Rules, a non- graduate Supervisor would not have been qualified for promotion to the post of Assistant Engineer.[1474H; 475A-D;
 476E-F] (iv)This Court has held that educational qualification could form a valid basis for classification. [479C] State of Mysore v. Narasing Rao [1967] INSC 197; [1968] 1, S.C.R. 407, (Union of India v. Dr. (Mrs.) S. B. Kohli, [1972] INSC 305; [1973] 3 S.C.C. 592, and State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa, [1973] INSC 180; [1974] 1 S.C.C. 19, relied on. Morey v. Doud, [1957] USSC 98; 354 U.S. 457, 473 referred to.
 But, where graduates and non-graduates are both regarded as fit and, therefore, eligible for promotion, it is difficult to see. how consistently with the claim for equal opportunity, any differentiation can be made between them by laying down a quota of promotion for each and giving preferential treatment to .graduates over non-graduates in the fixation of such quota. The result of fixation of quota of promotion for each of the two categories of Supervisors would be that when a vacancy arises in the post of Assistant Engineer, which. according to the quota is reserved for graduate Supervisors, a non-graduate Supervisor cannot be promoted to that vacancy, even if he is senior to all other graduate Supervisors and more suitable than they. His opportunity for promotion would be limited to vacancies available for non-graduate Supervisors. That would ,clearly amount to denial of equal opportunity to him. But even so, this Court ,cannot be persuaded to strike down the Andhra Pradesh Rules in so far as they make differentiation between graduate and non-graduate Supervisors. This differentiation is not something brought about for the first time by the Andhra Pradesh Rules. It has always been there in the Engineering Services of the Hyderabad and the Andhra States.
 The graduate Supervisors have always been treated as a distinct and separate class from non-graduate Supervisors both under the Hyderabad Rules as well as under the Andhra Rules and they have never been integrated into one class.
 In fact. under the Andhra Rules, a different nomenclature of Junior Engineers was given to graduate Supervisors. The same differentiation into two classes also persisted in the reorganised State ,of Andhra Pradesh with regard to the pay scale and also in the common gradation list of Supervisors finally approved by the Government of India. The two categories of Supervisors were thus never fused into one class, and no question of unconstitutionality could arise by reason of differential. treatment being given to them.
