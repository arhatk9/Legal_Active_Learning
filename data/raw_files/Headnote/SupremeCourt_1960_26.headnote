 The respondent had made an application under s. 53-C Of the Companies Act, 1913, with an alternative prayer for winding up against the appellant company, to the District judge, Poona, who had been authorised under the Act to exercise jurisdiction. While the application was pending the Companies Act, 1913, was repealed by the Companies Act, 1956. The appellant company thereupon applied to the District judge to dismiss the application on the ground that he had ceased to have any jurisdiction to deal with the application on the repeal of the Companies Act Of 1913.
 Held, that s. 6 of the General Clauses Act preserved the jurisdiction of the District judge to deal with the application under S. 153-C Of the Indian Companies Act Of 1913, notwithstanding the repeal of that Act.
 Section 647 of the Companies Act, 1956 did not indicate any intention to affect the rights under the Indian Companies Act of 19I3, for s. 658 of the Companies Act of 1956 made s.
 6 of the General Clauses Act applicable notwithstanding anything contained in s. 647 of that Act.
 86 Section 24 of the General Clauses Act does not put an end to any notification. It does not therefore cancel the notification issued under the Indian Companies Act of I9I3 in so far as that notification empowered the District judge to exercise jurisdiction under s. 153-C of the Indian Companies Act of I9I3 even though under s. 10 of the Companies Act of 1956, a District judge can no longer be empowered to exercise jurisdiction under (a) sections 1397 to 407 of the Companies Act, 1956, which correspond to S.
 I53-C Of the Indian Companies Act, 19I3 or (b) in respect of the winding up of a company with a paid up share capital of not less than Rs. 1,00,000/- which the appellant company was.
