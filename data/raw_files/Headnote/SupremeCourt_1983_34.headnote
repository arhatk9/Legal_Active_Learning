 In response to the notice issued to her under section 260 (1) (a) of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 the respondent contended that the impugned construction of walls without the sanction of the municipal corporation was in existence when she had purchased the premises. She then filed a suit in the City Civil Court and obtained permanent injection restraining the corporation from removing the impugned unauthorised construction. The decree of the lower court was affirmed by a single Judge of the High Court in appeal and in further appeal a Division Bench held that the impugned notice was beyond the powers of the Corporation in that a notice under the section could only be issued against the person who had constructed the building or who was constructing the building.
 On further appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that section 260(1) (a) read in conjunction with the latter part of section 478 empowered the Corporation to take action for demolition or removal of unauthorised construction both against the person who had commenced or was constructing the building as well as the person who was the owner of the building which had been constructed or erected without permission in violation of the laws.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: Although the impugned notice was not issued under section 478, it cannot be said that the notice was unauthorised or illegal. The question in this case being one of construction of a provision of a statute that construction must be made as to be in conformity with its other provisions and the provisions must be read as a whole.
 Section 478 can be relied upon in support of the notice under section 260(1) (a). [680 H; 681 A-B] 677 It is well settled that a wrong reference to the power under which action was taken by the Government would not perse vitiate that action if it could be Justified under some other power under which government can lawfully do that act.

 [1964] 52 I.T.R. 583; and Nani Gopal Biswas v. The Municipality of Howrah, [1957] INSC 92; [1958] S.C.R. 774 @ 779 relied on.
 Pitamber Vajirshet v. Dhondu Navalapa, [1888] I.L.R. 12 Bombay, 486 @ 489, approved.
 It is equally well settled that even where the usual meaning of a language falls short of the whole object of the legislature, a more extended meaning may be given to the words if these are fairly susceptible of it. But the construction must not be strained to include cases plainly omitted from the natural meaning of the words. [682 C] In the instant case if the provisions of section 260 (1) (a) are read in cojunction with the latter part of the provisions of section 478 which stipulates specifically that if the person carrying out such work or doing such things is not the owner at the time of such notice, the owner at the time of giving such notice shall also be liable for carrying out the requisition of the Commissioner, it is clear that the action for demolition or removal can be taken by the Corporation exercising power under the provisions of the Act against persons who had not themselves built the impugned portion. These provisions are devised to regulate the building construction for the safety, health and well-being of the inhabitants of the municipality. It would be anomalous to hold that if a building was constructed illegally or in an unauthorised manner action could only be taken against the person who did the illegal act but that after the construction was passed over to others the building would enjoy immunity from any action in respect of the same.
