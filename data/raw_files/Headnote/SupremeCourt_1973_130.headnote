 The plaintiff (respondent herein) executed an agreement on 9-10-1962 with defendant no. 1 whereby the latter agreed to sell to the former his house in Hyderabad for a sum of Rs.
 60,000. The plaintiff paid a sum of Rs. 2,000 as earnest money. However, dependent no. 1 sold the property in question on 19-10-1962 to defendants 2 to 7 for a sum of Rs.
 70 , 000. The plaintiff consequently filed a suit for specific performance of the agreement. The suit was resisted by defendant no. 1 on the ground that the plaintiff had obtained the agreement dated 9-10-1962 as a result of misrepresentation and fraud. The trial court held that misrepresentation and fraud had not been proved but the plaintiff had obtained an "unfair advantage'. On this view the trial Court dismissed the suit for specific performance.
 It ordered the repayment to the plaintiff of the earnest money paid by him. Inter alia the trial court also ordered the payment of Rs. 20,000 to the plaintiff as liquidated damages or penalty as stipulated in the agreement of 9-10- 1962. In appeal the High Court decreed the plaintiff's suit disagreeing with the view of the trial Court that the plaintiff had obtained an unfair advantage. The High Court granted the defendants a certificate of fitness to appeal to this Court. It was contended on behalf of the defendants- appellants that the parties themselves having stipulated for Rs. 20,000 as liquidated damages in the event of a breach by the first defendant, the presumption contained in the explanation to a. 12 of the Specific Relief Act 1877 stood rebutted. It was also contended that once the aforesaid presumption was rebutted the bar contained in section 21 of the Act would ipso facto become operative.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) A reference to s. 22 of the Act of 1877 (corresponding to a. 20 of the Specific Relief Act 1965) would show that the jurisdiction of the Court to decree specific relief is discretionary and must be exercised on sound and reasonable grounds "guided by judicial principles and capable of correction by the Court of appeal". This jurisdiction cannot be curtailed or taken away by merely fixing a sum even as liquidated damages. This is made perfectly clear by the provisions of s. 20 of the old Act (corresponding to a. 23 of the Act of 1963) so that the Court has to determine, on the facts and circumstances of each case before it, whether specific performance of a contract to convey a property ought to be granted. [319G-H] The fact that the parties themselves specified a sum of money to be paid in the event of its breach is, no doubt, a piece of evidence to be considered in deciding whether the presumption has been repelled or not. But, it is nothing more than a Piece of evidence. It is not conclusive or decisive. [32OA-B] (ii) The contention that once the presumption contained in explanation to s. 12 of the old Act is removed, the bar contained S. 21 of the old Act against the specific enforcement of a contract for which compensation in money is an adequate relief, automatically operates, overlooks that the condition for the imposition of the bar is actual proof that compensation in money is adequate on the facts and circumstances of a particular case before the Court. The effect of the presumption is that the party coming to the court for the specific performance of a contract for sale of- immovable property need not prove anything until the other side has removed the presumption. After the evidence is led to remove the presumption, the plaintiff may still be in a position to prove, by other evidence in the case, that payment of money does not compensate him adequately. [320G- E] In the present case, although, evidence was led by parties, yet there was no evidence to show the extent of loss of prospective gains to the plaintiff-respondent or to the appellants. [320E-F] 313 (iii) Since the presumption under s. 12 of the old Act had not been rebutted the High Court rightly decreed the suit for specific performance of the contract. It could not be said that the High Court had lightly interfered with the exercise of its discretion by the trial court to grant or not to grant specific performance on the facts and circumstances of the case.
