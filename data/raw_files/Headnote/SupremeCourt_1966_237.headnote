 The appellant's father purchased a house in the joint names of himself and his wife. In 1954 the parents made a gift of the said property to their two sons including the appellant.
 The document recited that the donees had accepted the gift and they had been put in possession. Thereafter, the sons paid the municipal tax but the parents continued to reside.
 in the house and the father continued to look after its affairs as head of the family. The father died in 1959, more than four years after the gift and the question arose in Estate Duty proceedings whether the said house was to be included in the estate of the deceased for the purpose of the duty or not. The Assistant Controller of Estate Duty and the Central Board of Revenue decided against the appellant (who was the accountable per,son) and thereafter a 'reference was made to the High Court. That Court also having given an adverse verdict the appellant came to this Court. It was contended on his behalf that the deceased had no enforceable right against his sons and therefore s, 10 of the Estate Duty Act was not attracted to the case.
 
HELD : The crux of s. 10 lies in two parts : (1) the donee must bona fide have assumed possession and enjoyment of the property which is, the subject-matter of the gift to the exclusion of the donor, immediately upon the gift, and (2) the donee must have retained such possession and enjoyment of the property to the entire exclusion of the donor or any benefit to him by contract or otherwise. Both these conditions are cumulative. Unless each of them is satisfied the property would be liable to estate duty under s. 10 of the Act. [1007 G] Attorney-General v. Earl Grey, [1898] 2 Q.B.D. 534, relied on.
 (ii)The second part of s. 10 has two limbs : the deceased must be entirely excluded (i) from the property and (ii) from any benefit by contract or otherwise. The word 'otherwise' must be construed ejusdem generis and must be interpreted to mean some kind of legal obligation or some transaction enforceable at law or equity which though not in the form of a contract may confer a benefit on the owner.
 [1008 B] But the words by contract or otherwise in the second limb of the section will not control the words 'to the exclusion of the donor' in the first limb. In other words to attract the section it is not necessary that the possession of the donor of the gift must be referable to some contractual or other arrangement enforceable in law or in equity. Even if the donor is content to rely upon the mere filial affection of his sons with a view to enable him to continue to reside in the house it cannot be said that he was 'entirely excluded from possession and enjoyment' within the 1005 meaning of the first limb of the section, and therefore the property will he deemed to have passed on the death of the donor and will be subject to the levy of estate duty. [1008 E-G] Chick v. Commissioner of Stamp Duties of New South Wales, 1958 A.C. 435 and Commissioner of Stamp Duties of New South Wales v. Owens, [1953] HCA 37; 88 C.L.R. 67, relied on.
 Attorney-General v. Seccombe, [1911] 2 K.B. 688, referred to.
 (iii)The appellant could not take advantage of the amendment made by the Finance Act, 1965 in s. 10 of the Estate Duty Act, 1963. The said amendment was effective only from April 1, 1965 and was not retrospective.[1010 F] (iv)It was the Board's finding that though the property stood in the joint names of the deceased and his wife she was only a name-lender and the entire property belonged to the deceased. In view of this finding it was not possible to accept the argument of the appellant that only half share of the property should be taken for the purpose of estate duty assistant. [1011 B]
