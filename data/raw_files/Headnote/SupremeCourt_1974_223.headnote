 Under the Bengal Finance, (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, the definitions of 'goods and 'dealer' are very comprehensive and general, and they cover 'cigarettes' and a dealer in cigarettes. Under s. 5 a dealer would be entitled to purchase free of tax goods required by him for use in the manufacture of cigarettes Section 23 of the ,rest Bengal Safes Tax Act, 1954, excepts everything relating to cigarettes from the operations of the 1941-Act, save to the extent indicated in the proviso to that section, which retains the benefit under s. 5(2) (a) (ii) of the 1941-Act.
 As a consequence of the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special importance) Act, 1957 (Central Act 58 of 1957), the West Bengal State legislature passed the West Bengal,,Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1958 This Act amended the 1954 Act, by. substituting the words 'certain notified com- modities' for the words 'cigarettes and other commodities.' The 1958-Act also substituted new ss. 23 and 25 in the 1954- Act. Under the, new s. 25, the 1954-Act can be made applicable by a notification only to a commodity 'which is liable to taxation under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941' and further. the 1941-Act 'shall cease to apply to such commodity' and the 1954Act shall apply to such commodity, only from the date of such notification.
 The appellant-company claimed that as a result of the 1958- Act, the 1941Act was applicable to cigarettes and as such it was entitled to the benefit of s. 5(2)(a)(ii) of the 1941- Act and that the Sales Tax Authorities were not competent to amend the registration certificate issued to it under the 1941-Act The Commercial Tax Officer rejected the contention and asked the appellant for its registration certificate for amendment and deletion of exempt-ion. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court, challenging the threatened action and the writ petition was allowed by a Single Judge.
 In L.P. Appeal, the Division Bench of the High Court held that the 1954 Act had the effect of completely repealing the 1941-Act, in relation to cigarettes, that the 1958-Act did not revive the operation of the 1941-Act and that since the 1941-Act stood completely obliterated from the statute book in relation to cigarettes, no sales tax would be payable in regard thereto either under 1954-Act or under the 1941-Act, and that therefore, the appellant was not entitled to any certificate of registration under the 1941-Act.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (1) The general rule of construction is that the repeal of a repealing Act does not revive anything repealed thereby. But the operation of the rule is not absolute and is subject to the appearance of a 'different intention in the repealing statute, which may be explicit or implicit.
 Repeal connotes abrogation or obliteration of one statute by another, from the statute book, as completely as it if had never been passed. When an Act is repealed, it must be con- sidered (except as to transactions past and closed) as if it had never existed Repeal is not a matter of form but one of substance, depending upon the intention of the Legislature.
 If the intention was to abrogate or wipe off the former enactment, wholly or in part, then it would be a case of total or protan to repeal. If the intention was merely to modify the former enactment by engrafting an exception or granting an exemption, or by super-adding conditions, or by restricting, intercepting or suspending its operation, such modification would not amount to a repeal.

 A. Tulloch & Co., [1963] INSC 170; A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 1284 and Mount v. Taylor referred to.
 (2) The High Court was wrong in holding that s. 23 of the 1954-Act repeals the 1941-Act with regard to cigarettes and that cl. (ii) of its proviso does not save the operation of a. 5 of the 1941-Act but only makes it a part of the 1954- Act. The words 'in calculating the taxable turnover under s. 5 of the said Act' in s. 23 of the 1954-Act show beyond doubt that the calculation of the taxable turnover from which the deduction of the price of goods sold to a dealer for use in manufacturing cigarettes is to be made, has still to be done under s. 5 of the 1941-Act. Assuming that cl.
 (ii) of the Proviso incorporates by reference, s. 5 of the 1941-Act in a modified form, then also such incorporation would not per se amount to a repeal, in the sense of complete obliteration of S. 5 of the 1941-Act. [619F-620A] (3)(a) A conjoint reading of the 1941, 1954 and 1958-Acts shows that the 1954-Act did not repeal or obliterate the 1941-Act. but only modified it by excepting cigarettes from its operation. During the interregnums between the enactment of the 1954-Act and the 1958-Act, the operation of the 1941-Act with regard to cigarettes was in a state of mere interception, and when as a result of the amendment made by the 1958-Act, that exception or interception was removed, the application of the 1941-Act to cigarettes revived proprio vigore. After the 1958-Act, cigarettes could be. notified under the amended s. 25 of the 1954 Act.
 It necessarily implies that the 1941-Act would cease to apply to cigarettes only when the requisite notification in respect thereof under s. 25 of the 1954-Act is issued. If such a notification were issued and later on rescinded, such rescission would revive the application of the 1941-Act.
 The position would be the same, as in the present case, if a notification under s. 25 specifying cigarettes as a taxable commodity was not at all issued. [621C-D, P-G] (b) Further, the 1941-Act was amended by Bengal Act 13 of 1959. In obedience to, the mandate of s. 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act of 1957, it reduced the rate of tax from 5 np.
 in the rupee to 2 % of such part of the taxable turnover of a dealer under the 1941-Act as represents sale of goods (including manufactured tobacco and cigarettes) referred to in s. 14 of the Central Act. This amendment of the 1941- Act, effected in 1959, also indicates that after the 1958- Act, the operation of the 194 1 Act revived in relation to cigarettes. [621D-F]
