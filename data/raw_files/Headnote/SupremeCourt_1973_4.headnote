 This Court, in Shree Krishna Agency Ltd. v. C. I. T.
 (Central) Calcutta, (1971) 82 I.T.R. 372, had held that in the absence of evidence to show that the directors had been exercising their power to. decline to register any transfer of shares freely and had thus virtually eliminated the element of free transferability of the shares in the ,company, the mere existence of a power in the Memorandum and Articles of Association giving such as discretion could not be said to affect the free transferability of the shares as contemplated by the Explanation to s. 23A, of the Income- tax Act, 1972. [20GD-E] In the present case, more than 75% of the shares of the assessee company were held not by a group or partners but by two public companies in which the Tribunal found, the public were substantially interested : there was no material to show that any group acting in concert was in control of the assessee company, and.. though the Memorandum and Articles of Association gave a discretion to the directors to decline to register a transfer of shares there was not evidence to show. that the directors had eliminated the element of transferability of shares.
