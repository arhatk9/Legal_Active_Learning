 The assessee was a dealer in Mysore dealing in powerloom textiles. His turnover in the course of inter-state trade was assessed and taxed by the Commercial Tax Officer, under s. 9 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1954, before its amendment in 1958. The order was upheld by the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal. The High Court, in revision, held that the sales were not "first sales" within the State, and that not being exigible to tax under the State Sales Tax Act (Mysore Act 25 of 1957), no tax was payable under the Central Act. The State appealed to the Supreme Court and contended that the assessee was liable to be taxed because of s. 6 of the Central Act 
HELD : (Per Subba Rao and Sikri, JJ.) Though s. 6 of the Central Act is the charging section the liability to pay tax is subject to the other provisions in the Act. Section 8(2) provides that tax shall be calculated at the same rates and in the same manner as would have been done if the had in fact, taken place inside the appropriate State, and s. 9 provides that, under the Central Act, tax shall be levied in the same manner as the tax on the sale or purchase of goods, under the general sales tax law of the State is assessed, paid and collected. The word "levied" means "imposed" and since s. 5(3)(a) of the Mysore Sales Tax Act, read with Schedule H of that Act provides that the tax shall be levied, in the case of powerloom goods on the first or the earliest of successive dealers in the State, and the assessee was not such a dealer, no tax could be levied on him in respect of the disputed turnover. Such a construction avoids the anomaly of the State collecting tax on powerloom textiles only at a single point and the Centre, through the agency of the State authorities, collecting the said tax for and on behalf of the State at multi-points.
 [131 A; 132 G; 133 B, D-F, H] Per Shah, J. (dissenting) : The High Court was in error in regarding We* other than the first sales as exempted from liability to pay tax under the Central Act, when the sales sought to be taxed, were in the course of inter-state trade or commerce. [138 C-D] Section 6 of the Central Act charges inter-state transactions to tax. 'Me function of a. 8(2) is to prescribe the rate and the manner of calculation of tax : it is not intended to incorporate the entire procedural and substantive State law relating to tax. Section 9(1) and (2) establish that the machinery of assessment, collection and enforcement of liability prescribed by the State statute alone is incorporated in the Central Act. Neither s. 8(2) nor s. 9 cut down the plenary charge imposed by a. 6, nor 130 do they attract any exemptions from tax prescribed by the State law. [136 B-E]
