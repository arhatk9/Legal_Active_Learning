 The appellant issued a notice to the respondent Municipal Board on June 9, 1964, under s. 298 of the Assam Municipal Act (XV of 1957) which stated, inter alia that the State Government was of opinion that the Board was incompetent to perform its duties and it had come to the tentative conclusion that the Board should be superseded. The charges which were the basis of the tenatative conclusion were set out in the notice and the Board was asked to give an explanation in reply to these. After considering the explanation given by the Board, the State Government issued a notification on her 9, 1964-, superseding the Board for one year with effect from December 14, 1964 for reasons which were stated in the notification.
 The Board thereupon filed a writ petition challenging the notification on the grounds, inter alia, (i) that passing the order of auction the State Government had violated the principles of natural justice inasmuch as the proceedings resulting in supersession being quasi-judicial proceedings, the Board had been denied the opportunity of being per- sonally heard and of producing evidence; (ii) that the charges which were found proved in the notification of December 9, 1964 were not the same which were the subject matter of the notice of June 9, 1964; and (iii) that the State Government had already come to the conclusion that the Board should be superseded when it gave notice on June 9, 1964 and had thus pre-judged the issue even before the explanation of the Board had been received. The High Court accepted all these contentions and allowed the petition.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : allowing the appeal (i)Even assuming that the proceedings in question were quasi-judicial proceedings, there was no violation of the principles of natural justice in this case. What the section provides is that a notice should be given to the Board by the State Government and its explanation taken before an order under s. 298 is passed. When the provisions of s. 298 are fully complied with, is in this case, and the Board does not ask for an opportunity for a personal hearing, principles of natural justice do not require that the State Government should ask the Board to appear for a hearing and to produce materials in support of the explanation. [735 D-F-, 736 C] (ii)A careful examination of the notice and the notification showed that the charges found proved were substantially the same as the charge levelled. [736 F] 733 (iii) The High Court had wrongly used the analogy of Art. 311 for the purpose of s. 2,98 in holding that the appellant should not have indicated its tentative conclusion in the notice because s. 298 provides for two courses ie., superssion or dissolution, and the appellant could not decide between the two alternatives even tentatively before taking into consideration the explanation of the Board.
 There was no reason why, when giving notice, the State Govermment should not indicate to the Board tentatively which of the two alternatives it iuntends to pursue. Such tentative conclusion communicated to the Board does not mean that the State Government is not open to conviction at all and whatever the explanation it would pass an order in accordance with its tentativ conclusion [737 E-G]
