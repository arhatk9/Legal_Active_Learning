 The appellant was a registered dealer carrying on business in bidis. For the year 1949-50, i.e., for the period from October 22, 1949 to November 9, 1950 he submitted only one return on October 5, 1950 for one quarter and defaulted in respect of the other quarters. He was served a notice on August 13, 1954 under s. 11(1) and (2) of the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, in respect of the turnover for the said period. There after, he filed the returns, but in the assessment proceedings he contended inter alia, that the proceedings before the sales tax commissioner were barred by time. This contention was rejected and his tax liability was determined. Then the appellant moved the High Court in writ petition. In the other appeal No. 102/1961, the appellant had not filed any return for the year 1950-51 i.e.
 for the period from November 10, 1950 to October 31, 1951.
 He was served a notice on October 15, 1954, under s. 11(4) of the Act. The said notice was within 3 years from October 16, 1951 which fell within the 4th quarter of the concerned year. The appellant then, filed his returns under protest and contended that the assessment proceedings Were barred by limitation under s. 11(A) of the Act. This plea was re- jected and his tax liability was determined. The appellant then, filed another writ petition for a similar relief.
 Both the writ petitions were heard together and the learned single Judge relying on a decision in Firm Sheonarayan Matadin v. Sales Tax Officer, Raipur, quashed the said assessments. The respondent then, filed Letters Patent Appeals before the Division Bench and by a common judgment the orders of the learned single Judge were set aside. In this Court, the appellant contended : (1) the expression "escaped assessment" in s. 11-A of the Act would apply also to a case where there was no assessment at all ; (2) even if the first assessment proceedings were pending before the appropriate authority, it could only make the assessment within three years from the date of the commencement of the said proceedings, which would start only after the appropriate authority issued a notice under s. 10(1) or s.
 11(2) or s. 11(5) of the Act; (3) in the present case no proceedings in respect -of the said assessment were pending and (4) as only a part of the fourth quarter in the second appeal falls within three years, 437 the proceedings in respect of the said entire quarter would be barred under s. 11-A of the Act and, in any view only the turnover escaped in respect of the period between November 10, 1950 to October 31, 1951 could be assessed. The respondent mainly contended that whatever may be said in the case of an unregistered dealer, in the case of a registered dealer the proceedings commence from the date fixed in the registration certificate within which the said dealer has a statutory obligation to furnish his return.
 Held : (Raghubar Dayal, J. dissenting) : The expression "escaped assessment" in s. 11-A of the Act includes that of a turnover which has not been assessed at all, because for one reason or other no assessment proceedings were initiated and therefore, no assessment was made in respect thereof.

Com- missioner of Income-tax, Bihar and Orissa, [1959] Supp. - S.C.R. 10 Maharajadhiraj Sir Kameshwar Singh v. State of Bihar, [1959] INSC 88; [1960] 1 S.C.R. 332, Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Narsee Nagsee & Co. [1960] 3 S.C.R. 988 and State of Madras v. Balu Chettiar, (1956) 7 S.T.C. 519,relied on.
 The assessment proceedings under the sales tax must be held to be pending from the time the said proceedings were initiated until they were terminated by a final order of assessment. Before the final order of assessment, it could not be said that the entire turnover or a part thereof of a dealer had escaped assessment, for, the assessment was not completed and, if completed, it might be that the entire turnover would be caught in the net.
 In re Lachhiram Basantlal, (1930) I.L.R. 58 Cal. 909 and Rajendra Nath Mukherjee v. Income-tax Commissioner, (1938) L.R. 61 I.A. 10, referred to.
 Under sub-section (1) of s. 10, the Commissioner need not issue a notice to a registered dealer for furnishing the relevant returns, but a statutory obligation is imposed on the said dealer to do so by such dates and to such authority as may be prescribed.
 In the case of a registered dealer there are four variations in the matter of assessment of his 'turnover : (1) He submits a return by the date prescribed and pays the tax due in terms of the said return; the commissioner accepts the correctness of the return and appropriates the amount paid towards the tax due for the period covered by the return.
 (2) The Commissioner is not satisfied with the correctness of the return ; he issues a notice to him under s. 11(2), and makes an enquiry as provided under the Act, but does not finalize the assessment. (3) The registered dealer does not submit a return; the Commissioner issues a notice under s.
 10(3) and s. 11(4) of the Act. (4) The registered dealer does not submit any return for any period and the Commissioner issues notice to him beyond three years.
 438 In the case of a registered dealer the proceedings before the Commissioner starts factually when a return is made or when a notice is issued to him either under s. 10(3) or under s. 11(2) of the Act. The acceptance of the contention that the statutory obligation to file a return initiates the proceedings is to invoke a fiction not sanctioned by the Act.
 Bisesar House v. State of Bombay (1958) 9 S.T.C. 654 and Ramakrishna Ramnath v. Sales Tax Officer, Nagpur, (1960) 11 S.T.C. 811, distinguished.
 A statutory obligation to make a return within a prescribed time does not proprio vigore initiate the assessment proceedings before the Commissioner; but the proceedings would commence after the return was submitted and would continue till a final order of assessment was made in regard to the said return.
 In the first case, therefore, the tribunal had no jurisdiction to issue a notice under s. 11-A with respect to the quarters other than that covered by return made by the appellant. In the second case, the Commissioner had jurisdiction to assess the turnover in respect of the entire fourth quarter, but as it was done without showing separately the assessment of tax payable in respect of each quarter, this Court cannot confine the relief to be given to the appellant in these appeals to the period barred under s.
 1 1-A of the Act. The appeals, therefore must be allowed.
 Per Raghubar Dayal, J.--The turnover for the years 1949-50 and 1950-51 could not be said to be turnover which escaped assessment, within the meaning of that expression in s. 11-A of the Act and therefore, the notices issued by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax in 1954 under s. 11(2) cannot be said to be notices issued under s. 11-A beyond the period within which they could have been issued.
 The proceedings for the assessment commence against the registered dealer from the prescribed date for his submitting the return which he is required to submit by sub- section (1) of S. 10. No notice is necessary to be issued to him for the submitting of the return for the purpose of assessment. The statute, by the provisions of sub-section, (1) of s. 10, gives him the required notice to the effect that he is to submit the necessary returns by the dates prescribed by the rules. The registration certificate issued to him mentions the period of the dealer's year, the prescribed return period and the dates by which the dealer had to furnish the returns. The registered dealer is, in this way, in no worse position than an ordinary dealer who receives a notice for -submitting the returns by a certain date. In the case of the unregistered dealer, the proceedings commence by the issue of a notice under subsection (1) of s. 10.
 There is no time limit fixed for the sales tax officer to take action against the registered dealer under sub-sections (2) and (4) of s. 11. He does not contravene Art. 14, if he takes action 439 against a registered dealer under sub-section (2) or sub- section 4 of s. 11 even after the expiry of three years from the period whose turnover is to be assessed.
