 The petitioners aged 16 and 20 were convicted for offences u/s 302 read with s. 34 and s. 307 I.P.C. and sentenced to life imprisonment by the trial Court and the High Court affirmed both the conviction and the sentence awarded to the accused.
 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court 
HELD: 1. Credibility of testimony, oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. While it is necessary that proof beyond reasonable doubt should be adduced in all criminal cases, it is not necessary that it should be perfect. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not a fetish and guilty man cannot get away with it because truth suffers some infirmity when projected through human processes. Judicial uestq for perfect proof often accounts for police presentation of fool-proof- concoction. Infirmity in some aspect or other of this prosecution case cannot invalidate the culpability which is otherwise veraciously made out. [394 D-F] The rationale of Court sentence is social defence coupled with personal correction. Article 21 of the Constitution is the jurisdictional root for legal liberalism. Courts are responsible to ensure that deprivation of liberty is accompanied by curative strategy and human dignity, by issuing certain positive directions in this regard. [397 B] The Court directed the State Government (a) to issue appropriate instructions to the jail authorities to give the prisoners treatment and work which are not likely to offend dignity and decency and if necessary in consultation with the medical officer; (b) If their behaviour shows responsibility and trustworthiness, to allow them liberal and cautious parole so that their family ties may be maintained and inner tensions may not further build up; (c) To enlarge them on parole for two months after every period- of one year, (d) to afford interviews by family members as often as are sought, and (e) to teach them useful crafts inside prison and encourage their studies. The Court fur- ther directed the Sessions Judge to make jail visits to ensure compliance with the above directions. [396 G-H, 397 A] OBSERVATION:
 Criminology is more than police "billy" and "peace and order" is more than smart F.I.R. It is positive action for prevention. detection and prompt prosecution. [395 G] [The Court reiterated the preventive action of the police u/ss. 149 to 151 contained in Ch. XI of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 "which duty has gone by default'] 394
