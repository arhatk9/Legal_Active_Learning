 The landlord, Prabhu's lands measuring 3 acres 25 gunthas were under the cultivation of rau, the tenant- appellant.
 The landlord u/s. 31 read with section 29 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1943 instituted a proceeding against the tenant.
 During the pendency of the proceeding Rau died and his tenancy rights were inherited by his four sons, the present appellants.
 The landlord on 27.4.1961 decided to sell the suit land to the fourth son of the demised tenant, who effected a partition of the property.
 On 24.5.1961, the proceeding u/ss.29, 31 of the Act was dismissed.
 Mahadu, one of the sons of Rau, sold his share in the suit land in favour of the respondent on 11.5.1966 by a registered deed.
 In 1969, the Tahsildar initiated proceedings u/s. 32G of the Act, and on 21.12.1969 by his order he declared the fourth son of Rau as the purchaser and also directed that a certificate u/s. 32 M read with section 43 of the Act should be issued to the tenants. He also held that the sale effected by Mahadu in favour of the respondent was contrary to law and directed the removal of the respondent's name from the revenue records.
 In the meanwhile one of the sons of Rau instituted a suit against the respondent for an injunction restraining him from obstructing his possession of the property. The respondent contested the suit contending that he, 102 being the purchaser of Mahadu's share, was entitled to remain in possession as a co-owner along with the plaintiff.
 The Civil Court u/s. 85 of the Act referred two issues for determination of the tenancy authorities, which were:- "(1) Was the plaintiff a tenant of the suit- property and did he subsequently become its deemed purchaser ? (2) Was the sale deed by Mahadu to Patel (respondent) invalid under Act?" The Tahsildar answered both questions in affirmative.
 In appeal, the findings of the Tahsildar, that the plaintiff was the deemed purchaser of the land on 1.4.1959 and that the transfer by Mahadu in favour of the respondent was hit by the provisions of section 43 of the Act, were confirmed.
 Respondent's revision was allowed by the Revenue Tribunal, holding at the sale by Mahadu in favour of respondent was not invalid; that the ons of Rau were deemed purchasers only on 24.5.1961 and became actual purchaser only on 21.12.1969, when the sale in their favour was regularised u/s. 32M of the Act.
 The High Court dismissed the revision petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution by the appellants, holding that section 64 did not prohibit the landlord from selling his land to the tenants by private agreements; that the ownership rights of the tenants were acquired not u/s.
 32 of the Act but by virtue of a sale between the landlord and the tenants;that since the sale was not one u/s.32, provision of section 43 of the Act were not attracted; and that the tenants became owners not on 24.5.1961 but on 27.4.1961.
 Against the order of the High Court by special leave, the present appeal was preferred by the tenants.
 The appellants-tenants-plaintiffs contended that the High Court erred in holding that the sale in favour of the appellants-tenants was not affected by section 64 of the Act.
 103 Disposing of the appeal on the question, whether by the sale deed dated 11.5.66 any valid title to the suit land was conferred upon the respondent the Court 
 HELD : 1.01. The High Court has over-looked the clear provisions of section 64(8), which declare that any transfer by a landlord after tiller's day would be void. The tenants could not, therefore, have acquired any rights or title under the sale deed executed by the landlord. [107H-108] 1.02. Though the order under section 32-G purports to ratify the earlier transaction of sale by the landlord to the tenants, the transaction acquires its validity not by virtue of the sale deed of 27.4.1961 but only by virtue of the order under section 32-M dated 21.12.1969. [108B] 1.03. On 11.5.1966 - the date of the sale to the respondent - the tenants (including Mahadu) had no title to the property which they could validly convey in favour of thr respondent. That title vested in them only on 21.12.1969, when the order under section 32G was passed.
 This being so, the logic that the transfer in favour of the respondent was not of property acquired under section 32 but of a property acquired by a voluntary process is not correct. [108B-C] 1.04. On the date of the sale deed in favour of the respondent, the vendor had no tittle to the land in view of the provision of section 64(8). Even if the subsequent conferment of title on them by the order under section 32G be treated to date back to 24.5.61, still Mahadu, being a tenant who acquired title under the Act, his sale to the respondent will fail in view of the of section 43(2) of the Act. [1980D] 1.05. The question referred to the tenancy courts by the civil court are answered accordingly by saying that the sale deed by Mahadu in favour of the respondent is invalid under the provision of the Act. The High Court erred in upholding the order of the Revenue Tribunal. [108F-G]
