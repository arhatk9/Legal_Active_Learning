 In a suit filed by plaintiff-respondent no.1 before the High Court defendant-appellants filed a joint application under s. 34 of the Arbitration Act for staying proceedings of the suit and referring the matter to arbitration. In view of some formal defects in the said application, the High Court on 25.2.1966 without mentioning the defects ordered.
 "Application withdrawn with liberty to make a fresh application". on 21.3.1966 the appellants submitted two separate applications for staying the suit in so far as it related to them or in the alternative for stay of the entire suit. The plaintiff-respondent resisted the applications as not being in terms of the order dated 25.2.1966. Upholding the objection, Learned Single Judge refused to stay the suit.
 On appeal, the Division bench of the High Court held that the liberty was granted to 'make a fresh application' and as such, under the provisions or Order XXIII, C.P.C., the appellants had no right to move two separate applications to stay the suit.
 In appeal by special leave to this Court it was contended that provisions or Order XXIII, C.P.C. were not applicable to applications filed under s. 34 of the Arbitration Act; and that the High Court committed an error in taking a technical view that as liberty was given to withdraw the application in order to make a fresh application, the appellants were not entitled to make separate stay applications. Respondent no. 1 supported the impugned judgment.
 Allowing the appeals, this Court, 810

 2. In the instant case, apart from s. 41 of the Arbitration Act providing for application of Code of Civil Procedure and there being no provision taking away provisions of order XXIII, C.P.C. from being applied to the applications for stay filed under s. 34 of the Arbitration Act, the proceeding started on a plaint filed by the plaintiff and in such a suit if any application was filed under the Arbitration Act, the same ought to be governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.
 [816A-c] 
 3.1 The High Court was not right in dismissing the applications on the ground that two applications were not maintainable as the same were not covered within its order dated 25.2.1966. [820E-F] 
 3.2 The term 'a fresh application' in the order dated 25.2.1966 used in singular had no more significance than the fact that as both the 811 appellants had submitted one joint application, liberty was given to make a fresh application, The main purpose of moving the applications under s. 34 of the Arbitration Act was to stay the suit proceeding. The intention and purpose of moving two such separate applications was also the same.
 The explanation given by the appellants was that they were given a legal advice to move two separate applications as there were two different agreements between appellants no. 1 and 2 and the respondent no. 1 There being no element of mala fide in the two applications having been submitted within 30 days of the order dated 25.2.1966, the same were maintainable .
