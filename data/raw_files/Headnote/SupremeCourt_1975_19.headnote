 There was a contract between the State and the respondent, which after the passing of the Bombay Housing Board Act, 1948, was deemed to have been entered into between the appellant and the respondent, for the construction of' buildings by the respondent. Clause 14 of the Contract provided that where any additional or altered work is directed to be carried out and no rates are entered in the Schedule of Rates in the Division, or agreed to, then. the contractor may, within 7 days of the order, give notice of the rate he intends to charge. In such a case, the Engineer-in-charge would be at liberty to cancel the order if he does not agree to the rate stated by the contractor, and get the work done by another. Where the Engineer-in charge has not cancelled the order and the contractor has commenced work and incurred expenditure, the contractor shall only be entitled to be paid at such rate as may be fixed by the Engineer-in-charge, and if the contractor is dissatisfied, he may raise a dispute about the rate and the decision of the Superintending Engineer will be final.
 Clause 15 provided that the Engineer-in-charge has power to stop or to reduce the whole of the work specified in the tender or get it done by another, and the contractor has no claim to any compensation whatsoever on account of such stoppage or reduction. But, before the Engineer-in-charge could stop the work and get it done by another contractor, he should give the first contractor a written notice. The contractor shall also have no right under the clause to, claim any payment or compensation on account of any profit or advantage which he might have derived from the execution of the work in full but which he did not derive in consequence of the full amount of work not having been carried out, or on account of any loss due to purchase of materials or labour recruited by him. The clause further provides that the contractor shall not also, have any claim for compensation by reason of any alteration in the original specification which may involve curtailment of work as originally contemplated.
 The respondent filed a suit claiming a certain sum of money with respect to certain items and the suit was decreed by the trial court except with respect to 4 items. The High Court in appeal. however decreed those items also. They were : (1) the respondent was ordered to carry out certain work with respect to the first two items and the respondent intimated his rate as required by cl. 14. The Engineer-in- charge did not cancel the order or give the contract for the extra work to any other contractor, and therefore, the High Court held that the amount due to the respondent for the extra work was to be calculated' on the basis of the rate specified in the notice; (2) the respondent was assured by the appellant that the work was to be completed in accordance with the specifications in the agreement and that no alteration would be made therein, but-in fact an alteration was made as a result of which the respondent became entitled to lesser amount and the High Court held he was entitled to the difference; and (3) the appellant represented to the respondent that the appellant would entrust the respondent with another item of work but contrary to the representation, got the work done by another without giving notice in writing to the respondent and hence, the High Court held that the respondent was entitled to compensation.
 408 In appeal. to this Court, it Was contended; (1) that with respect to the first items, in view of cl. 14, the respondent was entitled only to the rate as fixed by the Engineer-in-charge; (2) with respect to the 3rd item since the Engineer-in,charge was entitled to change the specifications, the respondent was not entitled to compensation in view of Cl. 15; (3) with respect to the 4th item no notice was necessary before getting the work done by another contractor; and (4) the suit was barred by limitation under s. 64 of the Bombay Housing Board Act, 1948, which provides a 6-month period of limitation for any suit for anything done or purporting to have been done in pursuance of the Act, because the act of entering into a contract was an act done in pursuance of the Act. and so a claim for damages for breach of the contract would come within the purview two items. [412E-F] 
HELD: (1) The High Court was wrong in allowing the claim on the first two items. [412E-F] The High Court erred in holding that cl. 14 was inapplicable. The High ,Court was also wrong in holding that if the clause was applicable it gave the Engineer-in- charge an absolute power to fix the rate and that it was unjust. Until the rates were settled by agreement the respondent was under no obligation to carry out the additional or altered work. The respondent could legitimately have said that in the absence of scheduled rates in the division for the type of work or an agreement in regard to the rates, it was not bound to carry out the additional or altered work. Merely because the Engineer-in- charge did ,not exercise his liberty to cancel the contract after receiving notice of the respondent's rate, it could not be said that there was a concluded contract 'between the parties for payment at those rates. The fact that an express power was given to the Engineer-in-charge by the clause to cancel the order if he did not agree to the rate would not mean that the failure to cancel the order ,would result in an agreement as to the rate or.rates. In the absence of some positive act on the part of the Engineer-in- charge agreeing to the rate, there was no agreement as to the rate and the respondent was not bound to carry out the work. The provision regarding fixation of rate by the Engineer-in-charge and 'by the Superintending Engineer was intended to cover cases where the notice specifying the rate was not given by the contractor, or when, even though the notice was given, the Engineer-in-charge did not cancel the order in the event of his not agreeing to the rate specified in the notice and the contractor ,commences work and incurs expenditure. [412B-E] (2) The High Court was right in its conclusion with respect to the 3rd item that cl. 15 had no application and that the claim was well-founded. The nature of the work was such that by altering the specification, there was not only no curtailment of work but there was in fact an increase of work involving additional cost. [413G] (3) The observance of the condition as regards the written notice in cl. 15 was mandatory, and since no such notice was given the respondent 'was entitled to damages. [414B] (4) The contract entered into by the Board for construction of buildings is an act done in pursuance of the provisions of the Act; and it makes no difference whether the contract was entered into with the Board or that it was deemed to 'be entered into with the Board., But the act complained of in this case by the respondent was the non-payment of the amount alleged to be due to the respondent on the basis of a breach of the contract; and that act could not be said to have been done or purported to have been done in pursuance of the Act. It could not said that the breach complained of had any reasonable connection with any duty cast upon the appellant or its agents by the Act. [415B; 417B] The Trustees of Port of Bombay v.
