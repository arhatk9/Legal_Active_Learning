 The question that arose for decision in these writ petitions and civil appeals was whether a tenant, in order to claim the right of purchase as against the land-owner, under s.
 18(1) of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act X of 1953 should have been in continuous occupation of the land comprised in his tenancy for a minimum period of six years on the date when the Act came into force (April 15, 1953), or on the date when he files the application for purchase to the concerned authority under the Act. A subsidiary point for consideration was whether the person who claims the right to purchase, should have been a tenant on the date when the Act came into force.
 
 HELD : In order to claim a right of purchase as against the land owner s. 18(1)(i) of the Act, the minimum period of six years should have been completed at the time when the application for purchase by the tenant is made, and it is not necessary that he should have been a tenant of the land on April 15, 1953. Provided the other conditions are satisfied such a tenant will be entitled to purchase the land. [808 G] Section 18(1)(i) gives a right to a tenant to purchase the land; and that right has to be examined when an application under s. 18 is made and cannot be denied on the ground that he was not a tenant for more than six years on April 15, 1953. There is no limitation placed under cl. (i) of s. 18(1) that the tenant who exercises his right should be a tenant on the date of the Act or that he should have completed the period of six years on April 15, 1953 and there is no warrant for reading in s. 18(1)(i) clauses which it does not contain. It is enough if the continuous period of six years has been completed on the date when the tenant files the application for purchase of land, [808 C] When the object of the Act as seen from clause (ii) of section 18(1) is to attract even a tenant who-got back into possession of the land after the date of Act, there is no reason why a limitation should be read into clause (i) in respect of a tenant who is in possession of the land that he should have completed the period of six years continuous occupation even prior to the date of the Act.
 Clause (iii) dealing with the third category of tenants, admittedly relates to a tenant evicted from the property even before the date of the Act and who was not in possession on the day when the Act came into force. But, nevertheless, if such tenants had been in continuous posses- sion for six years at the time of their ejectment which must be before the date of the Act, they are entitled to purchase the property but that right must be exercised within a period of one year from the date of the commencement of the Act. [807 B] It stands to reason that the tenants coming under clause (i) and (ii) who are in actual possession of the land have been given the option 797 either to continue as tenants and pay rent or to exercise their right to purchase the land at any time. There is no question in their case of there being any time-lagor doubt because,, being in possession no other person's right wilt normally be affected; whereas in the case of a tenant coming under clause (iii), he has already gone out of the land and therefore the Legislature has specifically provided a very short period of one year from the date of the Act for exercising, if he so chooses, his right to purchase the land provided he satisfies the other conditions mentioned in the section.
