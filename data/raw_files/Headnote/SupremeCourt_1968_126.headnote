 After a partition in his joint family in 1952, the appellant, together with his three minor sons, took over and carried on the family business. He Thereafter filed a suit in the business name against a firm claiming damages for certain infringements of trade marks. The trial Court re- jected a contention of the defendants that the suit was not maintainable because the appellant three minor sons had not been impleaded and decreed the suit. In the course of an appeal before a Single Beach of the High Court, the appellant filed an application for the addition of his three sons as parties and also :filed an, affidavit, as required by the Court, giving the respective dates of births of his three sons. As the appellant,who had a large family, did not remember the exact dates, he sought information from the school authorities and on the basis of this information, he stated the date of birth of one his sons as June 9, 1954 instead of December 12, 1951. While dismissing the appeal, the Court directed the appellant to show cause why he should not be prosecuted for committing an offence under sections 199 and 200 I.P.C. The appellant's plea that he had wrongly mentioned the date of birth due to a bona fide -mistake was rejected and a Division Bench, in appeal, refused to interfere with the order directing the appellant's prosecution.
 On appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : The -appeal must be allowed and the complaint against the appellant quashed.
 Before a person can be punished under s. 199, it has to be proved, inter alia, that the false statement is 'touching any point material to the ,object for which the declaration is made'. One of the ingredients of an ,Offence under s.
 200 I.P.C. is that the declaration should be used or attempted to be used corruptly. Neither of these requirements were shown to have been satisfied. Considering that the date of birth was obtained from the school records, and that the appellant stood to gain ,no advantage by giving a wrong date, the learned Single Judge should not have directed the lodging of a complaint under s. 199 or s. 200 I.P.C.
