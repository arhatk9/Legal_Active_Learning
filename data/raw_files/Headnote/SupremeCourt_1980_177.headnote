 Allowing the petition, the Court ^ 
 HELD : The so-called opportunity of being heard in person by the Advisory Board was a farce, and amounted to a negation of the right conferred on the detenu under Section 11(1) of the Prevention of Black-marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980. [693F].
 
 Under Section 11(1) of the PREBLACT, the authority
 concerned was peremptorily required to afford to the detenu a proper opportunity to be heard in person by the Advisory Board. Such an opportunity was not given to the detenu, here, despite request. No reasonable notice about the date of meeting of the Advisory Board was given to the detenu. It was only about one or two hours before the scheduled time of the meeting of the Board that a police officer went to the hospital, in which the detenu was confined, to inform about the meeting of the Board. Even that information was given only to the wife of the detenu for further transmission to the detenu who was then precariously ill and disabled from doing anything. In such circumstance, the respondents' argument that the detenu should have asked for extension of time is devoid of merit. [693D-E, G].
