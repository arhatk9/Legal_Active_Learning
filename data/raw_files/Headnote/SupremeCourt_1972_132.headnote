 In an appeal against acquittal, the High Court, while maintaining the acquittal of some of the accused, ;reversed it in respect of the appellants and convicted them of offences under s, 302 read with s. 34, I.P.C.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Under ss. 417, 418 and 423, Cr.P.C., the High Court has full power to, review at large the evidence upon which an order of .acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon the evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed. But in exercising this power the High Court should give proper weight and consideration 'to such matters as, (a) The views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (b) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at the trial; (c) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt, and (d) the slowness of the appellate court to disturb a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses. It should not only consider every matter on record having a bearing on the questions of fact and the reasons given by the Court below in support of its order of acquittal, but should express its reasons in its judgment which led it to hold that the acquittal was not justified. [478 E-H; 479 A-C] In the present case, the High Court did consider all the aspects considered by the Sessions Court, with most of which it has also concurred especially those aspects of the case in respect of which witnesses tried to embellish and exaggerate. But that by itself, does not assist the accused nor can the broad features of the evidence of the prosecution case be doubted in respect of its version.
 Merely because there have been discrepancies and contradictions in the evidence of some or all of the witnesses it did not mean that the entire evidence of the prosecution had to be discarded., It was only after exercising caution and care and sifting the evidence to separate the truth from untruth, exaggeration, embellishment and improvement, that the High Court had come to the conclusion that what could be accepted implicated the appellants and convicted them. This Court has held that falsus in uno falsus in omnibus'. is not a sound rule for the reason that hardly any one comes across witness whose evidence does not contain a grain of untruth or at any Ira some exaggeration or embellishment.. Where, however, the substratum of the prosecution case, or a material part of the evidence, could not be belived, it would not be permissible for the Court to reconstruct a story of its own out of the rest.
