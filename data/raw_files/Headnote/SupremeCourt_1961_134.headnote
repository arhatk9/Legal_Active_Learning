 An order had been made under s. 3(2)(C) Of the Foreigners Act, 1946, directing that the respondent, "a Pakistan national 745 shall not remain in India after the expiry of three days".
 The respondent moved the High Court of Punjab under Art. 226 of the Constitution to quash the order contending that he was not a Pakistan national. The High Court held that if there was Prima facie material to show that a person was a foreigner, a civil court would not go into the question whether he was a foreigner for under s. 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, that question had to be decided by the prescribed authority which under the Rules framed under the Act, was the Central Government. The High Court came to the conclusion that there was no Prima facie material on the basis of which an order under S. 3(2)(C) Of the Foreigners Act could be passed against the respondent and in that view quashed the order. On appeal by the Union of India by special leave, Held, that s. 9 of the Citizenship Act dealt with the termi- nation of the citizenship of an Indian citizen and had no application to this case as the Union did not contend that the respondent had been an Indian citizen whose citizenship had terminated.
 Section 8 of the Foreigners Act which made the decision` of the Central Government on a question of the nationality of a foreigner who is recognised as its national by more than one foreign country or when it is uncertain what his nationality is final, also did not apply as the only question in this case was whether the respondent was a foreigner or an Indian Citizen.
 The case was governed by s. 9 of the Foreigners Act under which when a question arises whether a person is or is not a foreigner, the onus of proving that he is not a foreigner is on that person.
 The High Court was in error In placing on the Union of India the burden of proving that the respondent was a foreigner.
