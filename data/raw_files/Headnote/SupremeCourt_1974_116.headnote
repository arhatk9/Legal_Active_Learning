 The appellant was holder of the Inam lands with abkari rights granted by the Nizam. By virtue of the said rights.
 the appellant was entitled to the full income of the rental licence fee for running liquor shops. tree tax and for tree owners' fee. The principal inam was abolished by the Hyderabad Inams Abolition Act 1955 (and also by Act 10 of 1956). The Andhra Pradesh Legislature passed Act No. 9 of 1967 repealing the 1955 and 1956 Acts. Act 9 of 1967 provided for the vesting of the Inam lands in the State without payment of compensation to the Inamdars. The Andhra Pradesh High Court struck down Act No. 9 of 1967. Acting under the provision of the 1955 Act the State denied the enjoyment of Abkari right to the appellant. He therefore filed a suit. Having lost before the trial court, and the High Court, the appellant approached the Supreme Court with the following contentions; (i) that the striking down of Act 9 of 1967 does not result in the revival of the Inam Abolition Act, 1955; (ii) that the Abkari rights are not included in the 'Inam' and were, therefore, not abolished by the Abolition Act; (iii) the Abolition Act does not provide for compensation for abolition of Abkari rights and was therefore hit by Art. 31 (2) of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The result of the striking down of Act 9 of 1967 was to revive the Abolition Act of 1955. The High Court was right in holding that the Inam lands had already vested in the State under the Abolition Act and. therefore, on the date when Act No. 9 of 1967 was passed, there was neither any estate which could be abolished nor was there any necessity to effect any agrarian reform. [434G] (ii) Under Sec. 2(2) of the inam Abolition Act, 1955, words and expressions used in the Act but not defined shall have the same meaning assigned to the said words in the Land Revenue Act 1317 Fasli, Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act 1950 and Hyderabad Atiyat Enquiries Act 1952 and the rules thereunder. S. 2(1-b) of the Andhra Pradesh Revenue Act 8 of 1317 Fasli defines land as including all kinds of benefit pertaining to lands or things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to earth and also includes shares in or charges on. the revenue or rent which are or may be levied on villages, or-other defined areas. The right to tap or derive benefit from trees standing on the lands is a right appurtenant to the lands because a thing attached to the land is itself a part of the land and is immovable property. Haque Malakana which-is the right in trees is therefore a right appurtenant to the land. When any Inam land vests in the Govt., the right to tap trees standing on the land also vests in the Govt. There cannot be any separation of these rights when the tree is still a part of the land. Right to receive rental or licence fee ('Baithak') for running sendhi shops at Inam lands appertains to the ownership of the land. [436E; 437H; 438BC] State of Bihar v. Rameshwar Pratap [1962] 2 S.C.R. 382.
 [wherein it is held that the right of the proprietor of an estate to hold a 'Mela' on his own land is a right in "estate being appurtenant to his ownership of the land" relied upon.] 430 Under Sec. 3(1) of the Abolition Act, vesting of the Inams in the Govt. is to take place notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of a Civil, Revenue or Atiyat Court. Thus Abkari rights being part of the Inam lands vest in the Govt., with the Abolition of the Inams. [438C] (iii) Abkari rights being part of the Inam and having been vested in the State, the compensation that payable u/s.
 12 of the Abolition Act is inclusive of the Abkari rights.
 As the Hyderabad Inams Abolition Act 1955 is a legislation intended to give effect to agrarian reforms by making the land available to the landless, compensation provided u/s.
 12 cannot be challenged. [439B]
