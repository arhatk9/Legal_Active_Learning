 The Election Tribunal allowed the petition challenging the appellant's election to the Council of States and declared the respondent elected. The appellant's appeal to the High Court was dismissed. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, he contended that : (i) the High Court was in error in not rejecting the election petition under s. 90(3) of the Representation of the People Act (43 of 1951) for non- compliance with the provisions of s. 81(3) of the Act, and (ii) the High Court was in error in rejecting one of the votes which was in his favour.
 HELD : (i) As there was a substantial compliance with s.
 81(3), the petition could not be dismissed under s. 90(3).
 [41F] Ch. Subba Rao v. Member, Election Tribunal, [1964] INSC 3; A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 1027, followed.
 (ii) As the elector by his writing on the ballot paper had left sufficient evidence of his identity which could lead to his identification, the ballot paper was rightly rejected.
 [48G] The words "any mark or writing by which the elector can be identified" in r. 73(2)(d) of the Conduct of Election Rules mean something more than a mere possibility of identification but do not require actual proof of identification before a vote can be invalidated. All that these words require is that there should be reasonable probability of identification by the mark or writing (other than that permitted by r. 37-A) and if there is such a reasonable probability of identification, the ballot paper would be invalidated.
