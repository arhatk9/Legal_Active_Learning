 It is now well-settled that the general custom of the Punjab being that a daughter excludes the collaterals from succession to the self-acquired property of her father the initial onus, therefore, must, on principle, be on the collaterals to show that the general custom in favour of the daughter's succession to the self-acquired property of her father has been varied by a special local custom excluding the daughter which is binding on the parties.
 It is also well-settled that though the entries in the Riwaj-i-am are entitled to an initial presumption in favour of their correctness irrespective of the question whether or not the custom, as recorded, is in accord with the general custom, the quantum of evidence necessary to rebut that presumption will, however, vary with the facts and circumstances of each case. Where, for instance, the Riwaj- iam lays down a custom in consonance with the general agricultural custom of the province, very strong proof would be required to displace that presumption; but where, on the other hand, the custom as recorded in the Riwaj-i-am is opposed to the custom generally prevalent, the presumption will be considerably weakened, Likewise, 1192 where the Riwaj-i-am affects adversely the rights of the females who had no opportunity whatever of appearing before the Revenue authorities, the presumption will be weaker still and only a few instances would be sufficient to rebut it.
 If the Riwaj-i-am produced is a reliable and a trustworthy document, has been carefully prepared, and does not contain within its four corners contradictory statements of custom, and in the opinion of the Settlement Officer is not a record of the wishes of the persons appearing before him as to what the custom should be, it would be a presumptive piece of evidence in proof of the special custom setup, which if left unrebutted by the daughters would lead to a result favourable to the collaterals. If, on the other hand, it is not a document of the kind indicated above, then such a Riwaj-i-am will have no value at all as a presumptive piece of evidence.
 The Riwaj-i-ams of the Gurdaspur district prepared by Mr.
 Kennaway in 1913 in so far as they purport to record the local custom as to the right of the daughter to succeed to the self-acquired property of her father are not reliable and trustworthy documents.
 The answer to question 16 and the answer to question 17 re- corded therein do not contain the correct record of custom.
 Held, that the appellants collateral within fourth degreea Saraswat Brahmin of Pathankot in the district of Gurdaspur had failed to discharge the onus that initially rested on him that the respondent (the daughter) was excluded by him in respect of the nonancestral property of her father and that therefore no burden was cast on her of adducing evidence of particular instances.
 The general custom laid down in para 23 of Rattigan's Digest of Customary Law that "a daughter is preferred to collaterals in regard to the self-acquired property of tier father" was approved by the Supreme Court.
