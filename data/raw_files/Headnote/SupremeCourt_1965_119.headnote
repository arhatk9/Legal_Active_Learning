 The State Transport Undertaking published a scheme in the Gazette for taking over the routes mentioned therein to the entire exclusion of the existing operators., Objections to the scheme were heard by the Chief Minister and the approved scheme with modifications was published. The draft scheme was published when the Rules of 1960 were in force and the approved scheme after the Rules of 1963 had come into force.
 Writ petitions were filed by various bus-operators challenging the validity of the approved scheme but they were dismissed.
 In their appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that : (i) It was not open, under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and the Rules there Linder, to the State Government, when approving the scheme to specify minimum and maximum number of motor vehicles to be put on each route and the minimum and maximum number of trips to be made on each route and in so far as the approved scheme made such a provision it was ultra vires- (ii) As the draft scheme only specified the maximum number of vehicles and trips as required by the 1960 Rules, but the approved scheme provided both for minimum and maximum number of vehicles and trips on each route as required by the 1963 Rules, there was no opportunity to the objectors to put forward their objections to that feature of the scheme; (iii) Rule 3 cls. (e) and (f) and rule 12, of the 1963 Rules, which provided for the specification of the maximum and minimum number of vehicles and trips in the scheme and for variation of the frequency of services on a notified route without exceeding the maximum number, were ultra vires; (iv) The scheme could not be deemed to have been approved as it related to inter-State routes and the approval the Central Government had not been obtained; and (v) The Chief Minister was not competent to hear objections on behalf of the State Government, but that it should have been done by the Minister in charge of Transport., 
HELD : (i) The specifying of both minimum and maximum number of vehicles and trips in the scheme was in accordance with the provisions of s. 68C and was not hit by s. 68E and was valid. [98 F-G] Section 68C itself provides that "particulars of the nature of the services to be rendered" should be given in the scheme and the intention is that such details should be given as are necessary to enable the objectors to make their objections. When the section speaks of the nature of services to be rendered, it refers to the classes of motor vehicles for carrying passengers or goods or both, and the scheme has to indicate which class of service is to be taken over. Also, the word "particulars" should be given its ordinary meaning of "details". There may be some 88 difficulty in working out a scheme containing minimum and maximum number of vehicles and trips, where exclusion is partial as compared to a case where exclusion is complete, but the task of making a proper adjustment by the Regional Transport Authority is not insuperabla and therefore, such a difficulty would not change the meaning of the word " particulars." Such details of the nature of services proposed to be rendered include not only the precise number of vehicles and trips but also the minimum and maximum number of vehicles and trips on each route; and such indication of the maximum and minimum number gives the necessary information to enable objectors to oppose the scheme even with reference to the adequacy of the service proposed to be rendered. .'Further, s. 46(c) and s. 48(3) (ii) indicate that specification of the minimum and maximum number of trips and vehicles is envisaged by the Act, and it is permissible and legitimate to refer to those sections, Besides, such a specification would subserve the purpose of Chap. IV-A of the Act inasmuch as it will provide for a certain amount of flexibility in the service to be rendered.
 Such a. provision for flexibility in the approved scheme itself, cannot be said to override s. 68-E or be a device to get round the section; and since the gap between the maximum and minimum, in the present case, was not wide, their fixation did not operate as a fraud on ss. 68C and 68E.
 [93A, 1), E-G: 94 G-H; 95A C-G; 97F; 98 B-GE] Dosa Satyanarayanan v. Andhra Predesh Stae Road Transport Corporation, [1961] 1 S.C.R. 642. distinguished.
 C.P.C. Motor Service v. State of Mysore, [1962] Supp. I S.C.R, 717 and C. S. Rowjee v. Stale of Andhra Pradesh, [1964] INSC 15; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 330. explained.
 (ii)The fact that there was some defect in the draft scheme, would not be fatal, if the approved scheme, as it finally emerged after the objections had been heard and decided under s. 68-D was in accordance with what was required by s. 68-C. [99E] There was no violation of principles of natural justice, because, objection was taken to the impropriety of only indicating a maximum in the draft scheme and that objection was met by the State Government by modifying the scheme and including a minimum also. [99 G-H] Dosa Satyanarayanana Murty v. Andhra Pradesh State Road Corporation, [1961] I S.C.R. 642. followed.
 (iii)Since it was permissible to specify the maximum and minimum 'number of vehicles and trips under s. 68-C, and since r. 12 should be read as giving power to the undertaking to vary the frequency between the maximum and minimum prescribed in the scheme, the rule are all valid.
 [100 F-G] (iv)The two termini of the route being within the State.
 the scheme ,did not deal with inter-State route-,. A road is different from 'I route and the criterion for determining if a route is intrastate or inter-State is to see whether the 2 termini are in the same State or not. [101 B-C] (v)The authority under s. 68-D to hear objections is the State Government. Therefore, some living person must hear objections on its behalf. Since the rule framed by the Government nominates the Chief Minister as the authority, he was competent to hear the objections. [101 D.E]
