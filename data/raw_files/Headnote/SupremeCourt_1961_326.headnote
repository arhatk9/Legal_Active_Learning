 Under the Superior Civil Services (Revision of Pay and Pension) Rules, 1924, framed by the Secretary of State for India-in-Council under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1919, members of the Indian Civil Service and their wives and children were entitled to passage benefits which 506 were made part of the salary or remuneration. By an amendment made in the Rules in 1926 the passage benefits, for purposes of administrative convenience ceased to be a part of the salary and became allowances or privileges. They were separately credited to the account of members of the Indian Civil Service and debited as and when they were availed of out of the general revenues of the State.
