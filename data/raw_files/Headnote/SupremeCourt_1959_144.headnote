 The Superintendent of Police initiated a departmental inquiry against the respondent, who was a Sub-Inspector, with respect to certain charges, found him guilty, and forwarded the report to the Inspector-General of Police, who was the authority competent to dismiss him, for necessary action. The Inspector-General sent a copy of the report to the respondent, called upon him to show cause against the proposed punishment of dismissal, considered his explanation, and passed an order dismissing him. The procedure followed was in accordance with Regulations 228 and 229 of the Central Provinces and Berar Police Regulations framed under s. 241 of the Government of India Act, 1935, corresponding to Art. 309 of the Constitution.
 On the question whether the Regulations were ultra vires because, under Art. 311, the authority empowered to dismiss (in this case the Inspector-General) must have himself initiated,or conducted the inquiry preceding the dismissal, 
HELD : Under the proviso to Art. 309, power is conferred on the President of India and the Governor of a State to make rules Regulating the conditions of service of persons appointed to the civil service of the Union or the State, as the-case may be, until provision in that behalf is made by an Act of the appropriate Legislature. 'Conditions of service' means all those conditions which regulate the holding of a post by a person right from the time of his appointment till his retirement and even beyond, in matters like pension etc., and includes rules relating to the dismissal of an officer. Article 311 (1) confers an additional right on the civil servant, namely, that no person holding a civil post shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed.
 But for that Article rules could have been framed even in respect to these matters under Art. 309. Article 311(l) however, does not, in terms, provide that the relevant disciplinary inquiry should also be initiated or conducted by the authority mentioned in the Article. Therefore, -rules could be framed under Art. 309 with respect to conditions of service other than those in Art. 311(l) and hence, the Regulations were not ultra vires the Constitution.
