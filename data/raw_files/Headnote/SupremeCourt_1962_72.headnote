 In 1924, the Trustees of Port of Bombay granted a lease of land for ten years to a partnership firm, with the covenant that the lessee would, at their own expense construct upon the said land, certain buildings to the specification. of the trustees. It was provided inter alia that the lessee would be at liberty to remove the buildings, erected by them, within three months after the expiration of the term.
 It is not clear what happened actually after the expiration of the term of ten years. In 1942, the Trustees granted to M/s. D and 0 their respective heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, a mnthly tenancy of the and together with the buildings standing thereon. It was agreed with them that on the 462 determination of the tenancy, they would have to remove such buildings as were standing upon the demised land. In 1947 M Is. D and 0 assigned then rights in the lease to one R and the appellant K which was accepted by the trustees. After due notice in 1956, the Trustees filed a suit for ejectment against R ard K, in the Bombay City Civil Court. R had died before the filing of the suit and the plaint was amended by striking out the name of R. The appellant as defendant took a number of pleas; (a) notice was invalid as 'it had been served only upon one of the lessees, (b) suit was bad for non-joinder of the heirs and the legal representatives of R, (c) jurisdiction of City Civil Court was challenged as the suit was governed by Rent Act, (d) and lastly, that the contract to deliver vacant possession was impossible of performance and the said impossibility rendered the' claim of the plaintiffs incompetent.
 Held, that once it is held that the tenancy was joint a notice to one of the joint tenants was sufficient, and the suit for the same reason was good.
 Held, further, that the suit as laid for vacant possession of the site and in the City Civil Court was competent.
 Held, that in view of the definition "premises" in s.5.(8) and the events leading to the amendment of s. 4, the amend- ment was enacted to cut down by a definition the operation the words "any premises belonging to the Government or a local authority" by excluding buildings which were occupied by sub-tenants even though the building belonged to the Government or continued to belong to it and any action of the Government or local authority in respect of the land falls to be governed by usb-s. (1) and not sub-s (4.) (a) of the Rent-control Act.
 Held, therefore, if the Government or a local authority wants to evict a person from the land, the provisions of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging Houses Rates (Control) Act, 1947, (lo not come in the way. For the same reason, the suit for ejectment does not have to be filed in the court of small causes, as requirtd by a Rent Control Act but in the City- Civil Court.
 If the 'original lessees took on lease not only the land but also the building, it is not open to their assignees to claim that the ownership of the Government extended only to the land and not to the buildings.
 If the appellant cannot evict his tenant so as to be able to remove the building, in exercise of the right conferred on him, that is an unfortunate circumstance, which does not serve to entitle him to defeat the rights of Port Authorities.
 463 Quere :-The Port Trust Authorities, whether can evict the sub-tenants ? Bhatia Co-operative Housing society Ltd. v. D.C. Patel, [1952] INSC 54; (1953) S.C.R. 185 and Bara Bhaywandas v. Bombay Corporation, A.I.R. 1956 Bom. 364, referred to.
