 In the 1982 Himachal Pradesh State Assembly elections the appellant Ram Chand Bhatia sponsored by Bhartiya Janata Party was declared elected defeating the next rival candidate Hardyal the respondent cum election petitioner cum official nominee of the Congress (I) Party by a margin of 3364 votes. Kanshi Ram sponsored by Janata Party secured 1049 votes while Vidhi Chand official nominee of the Communist Party of India secured 1889 votes. The respondent filed an election petition challenging the election of the appellant on the ground that Kanshi Ram, Janata Party candidate conspired with the appellant and other persons to get printed posts like the one annexed to the petition (as Annexure PA later on exhibited as PI during Trial) containing false statement of facts assailing the personal character of the election petitioner and to distribute the same during the election period with the object of prejudicially affecting the prospects of the election petitioner. The appellant contested the election petition denying the allegations made.
 The learned Judge held (i) that Kanshi Ram was not a necessary party to the election petition; and (ii) that the contents of Annexure PA pertain to the personal character and conduct of the election petitioner-respondent. He found that the appellant had distributed the offending poster, but refrained from giving any finding on the question whether his election agent or any other person with his consent had distributed the said poster. As regards the printing of the offending poster, the learned Judge found that even if it was 178 not proved that the poster in question was printed at the instance of the appellant or his election agent, the offence of corrupt practice is established in view of his finding that the appellant himself had distributed the offending poster. On these findings the election petition was allowed declaring the election of the appellant as void. Hence the appeal by Special Leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1. The impleadment of a candidate against whom a charge of corrupt practice has been made as a party is necessary only when the charge of corrupt practice was made against a "Candidate" as defined in section 79(b) of the Representation of the People Act, that is after he was nominated as a candidate.[191 D-F] 
 2.1 Section 123 of the Representation of People Act does not stop a man from speaking. It merely prescribes conditions which must be observed if he wants to enter Assembly or Parliament. The right to stand as a candidate and contest an election is not a common law right. It is a special right created by Statute and can only be exercised on the conditions laid down by the statute. [185 C-D] 
 2.2 In order to make out the charge of corrupt practice under sub-section 4 of section 123 of the Representation of People Act, the election petitioner has to show that (i) the impugned statement of facts was published by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of the candidate or his agent; (ii) that the statement was false and which the maker either believes to be false or does not believe to be ture; (iii) that the statement relates to the personal character and not to the political character of a candidate; and (iv) that the statement was reasonably calculated to prejudice the prospects of the other candidates' election. [186 E-F, 190 G-H, 191 A-B] Adverse criticism however severe, however undignified, ill mannered, however regretable it might be, in the interest of purity and decency of public life, in relation to the political views, position, reputation or action of a candidate would not bring it within the mischief of the statute. What is objectionable is a false statement of fact and not a false statement of opinion, however unfounded or unjustified. The 179 public or political character of a candidate is open to public view and public criticism. If a false statement is made about the political views or his public conduct or character the electorate would be able to judge the allegations on the merits and would not be misled by any false allegation in that behalf. It is on this theory that false statements of facts affecting public or political character of a candidate are not brought within the is chief of section 123(4). It is only when a person beneath the politician" is sought to be assaulted that subsection 4 of section 123 of the Act is attracted. [193 A-B D-F] 
 2.3 The burden of proof lies on the election petitioner to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the necessary facts which would establish the allegation of corrupt practices that have been alleged in the election petition. The Court does not hold such a charge proved merely on preponderance of probability. In judging whether a publication of the statement has affected the voters the Court has to ascertain whether the statement is reasonably calculated to prejudice the prospect of the candidate in an election by keeping in the forefront the electorate at the time of election. The Court has to consider the effect of impugned document on the ind of the ordinary voters who read the poster by the offending the personal character of a candidate.[185 B-C;
 194 E-F] Devi Prasad v. Malluram Singhania & Ors. [1969] 3 S.C.C. 595 referred to.
 In the instant case; (i) the election petition contains all the necessary facts to constitute corrupt practice within the meaning of sub-sections 3 & 4 of section 123 and as such the preliminary objection as to maintainability of the election petition has been rightly overruled; (ii) the allegation of corrupt practice against Kanshi Ram was before his nomination as a Candidate" and therefore he was not necessary party in the election petition; (iii) from the evidence on the record (a) it cannot be said that the statement of fact in Exhibit PA assailing the personal character of the respondent was false and not true. me learned Single Judge omitted to record any finding on this important aspect and he si ply assumed that he had recorded a finding in the early part of the judgment.(b) The election petitioner has failed to establish the first link of the charge that the appellant had got the offending poster printed as alleged in the election petition. Rather the allegation has been belied by PW 2 Om 180 Prakash Sarotri the election petitioner's own witness. If this important link of the charge has not been established it will be difficult to accept the allegation that the appellant his election agent or any other person with his consent distributed the poster in public meetings at various places. Further since the appellant would not support his opponent by reading or distributing a poster which invokes to vote for a rival candidate and it has not been established that the appellant has made a common cause with the contesting candidate to start vilification compaign against the respondent the appellant cannot be held responsible for what has been tone by Kanshi Rao or his brother and the post election fact sought to be relied upon is too meagre to warrant a conclusion that appellant and Kanshi Rao were in collusion when the latter had contested against the appellant. The mere fact that Kanshi Rao was happy over the success of the appellant or was garlanded alongwith the appellant in the victory procession cannot lead to the conclusion that they had a common cause.
