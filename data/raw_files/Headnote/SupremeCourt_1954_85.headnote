 The appellants were tried and convicted for offences under ss. 392 and 332 of the Indian Penal Code committed when they were exporting certain essential supplies, the export of which was prohibited and constituted an offence under s. 7 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946. It was contended that the appellants were already prosecuted for an offence under s. 70 the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1.946, and though convicted by the Magistrate, were acquitted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sagar, and on the basis of that judgment which was not brought to the notice of the High Court the appellants who and once been tried for the same offence and acquitted could not be tried again under the provisions of s.403(1),of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the same offence nor on the same facts for any other offence for which a different charge from the one made against them might have been made under s.
 236 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or for what they might have been convicted under s. 237 of the' Code of Criminal Procedure.
 Held, that neither s. 236 nor s. 237 was applicable and that sub-section (2) of s. 403 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was a; complete answer to the contention because the appall ants were not tried for the same offence as contemplated under s. 403(1) but for a distinct offence as contemplated by sub-section (2).
