 The appellant company carried on in the State of Orissa the business of manufacturing and selling paper and boards. It held a licence in Form L.4 under the Central Excise Act is prescribed by the Central Excise Rules., 1944. The company's factory and its premises were demarcated under the said Rules. The Factory enjoyed the benefit of a private railway siding in the factory area. In 1960 a new siding was constructed outside the original factory premises; the company's request to the Excise authorities to amend its licence so as to include the new railway siding in the factory area was refused. On February 27 and 28, 1961 the company loaded some wagons of paper after effecting clearance of these goods by payment of excise duty under r.
 52 of the Excise Rules. The wagons then passed into the hands of railway administration but as a pilot engine was not available they were shunted into the new siding. On March 1, 1961 new rates of excise duty came into force and the Deputy Superintendent of Central Excise demanded extra duty on the wagons loaded on February 27 and 28, 1961 on the ground that they we're found in the factory premises till 9.45 a.m. on March 1, 1961. The company relying on r. 9A of the Excise Rules submitted that the duty was payable at the rate in force on the date on which the duty was actually paid. In the alternative it submitted that the goods having been cleared and removed from the factory premises before, the midnight of February 28, 1961, could not be made liable for the enhanced duty which came. into force. on March 1, 1961. The contentions were not accepted by the Deputy Superintendent. Higher departmental authorities also rejected them. The company then filed an application for revision before the Government of India This also being rejected the company appealed by special leave to. this Court.
 
HELD : (i) In the case of manufactured goods, according to the provisos to r. 9, the payment of the duty and the clearance of goods maybe synchronous or the payment may be postponed although the goods may be removed. In the latter case, under the second part of r. 9A the critical time becomes the removal of the goods from the factory or warehouse; but if the payment of duty is made before the removal,, then under the first part of r. 9A the critical time is the payment of duty. [213 C] It cannot be said That the first part of r-. 9A relates to unmanufactured goods and the second part to manufactured goods. [212 F] (ii) In the present case the payment of duty was synchronous with the clearance of the goods because the gate pass under r. 52 can only be issued when the goods have actually been cleared for removal. The payment of duty and the removal of the goods bad both been effected before the change in the rate of duty. The recovery of enhanced duty from the appellant company was therefore erroneous. [213 D, G] 206 (iii) The Excise authorities had themselves refused to recognise the new railway siding as part of the factory and it could not therefore be said that the wagons being in the new siding must be treated as still in the factory.
