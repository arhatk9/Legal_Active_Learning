 On the death of the last male holder of the properties in dispute his two step mothers got possession of the properties. Claiming to be his nearest heirs, respondents 1 and 2 filed a suit for recovery of posses-%ion of the properties. After the High Court had, in appeal, passed a decree in their favour, the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, came into force, and when respondents 1 and 2 sought the execution of the decree in their favour, the appellant (who was one of the step mothers) filed objections, on the ground that she had been in possession of half the properties since the death of her husband, and that by virtue of the provisions of the Act, she had become full owner of the properties in her possession. The executing court accepted the contention and dismissed the execution petition. But the appeal to the High Court was allowed on the ground that the Act did not apply.
 In her appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that : (i) under s. 8 of the Hindu Succession Act, she, being the step mother, was entitled to inherit the proper- ties in preference to respondents 1 and 2, and (ii) by virtue of s. 14 she became the full owner of the properties and therefore the respondents. No. 1 and 2 could not be allowed to proceed with the execution.
 
 HELD : (i) The provisions of s. 8 are not retrospective in operation and therefore, where a male Hindu died before the Act came into force, that is, when succession opened before the Act, the section will have no application. [629 F] (ii) At the time of the death of appellant's husband the Hindu Women's Right to Property Act, 1937 had not come into force and so, when the Hindu Succession Act came into force, the appellant had no manner of title to the properties. Therefore, though the appellant was in possession of properties, that fact alone was not sufficient to attract the operation of s. 14. [629 H; 630 D] The object of the section is to extinguish the estate called "limited estate" or "widow's estate" in Hindu law and to make a Hindu woman, who under the old law would have been only a limited owner, a full owner of the property with all powers of disposition and to make the estate heritable by her own heirs and not revertible to the heirs of the last male holder. It does not in any way confer a title on the female Hindu when she did not in fact possess any vestige of title. The provisions of s. 14(1) cannot be attracted in the case of a Hindu female who is in possession of the property of the last male holder on the date of the commencement of the Act, when she is only a trespasser without any right to the property.
