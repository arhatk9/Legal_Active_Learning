 P and A carried on business. as Chartered accountants in the name of D.V. & Co.. On P retiring from partnership a deed of dissolution was executed which provided that the business would be carried on by A. By clause 2 of the deed, P, who owned the rights and interest in the goodwill, "agreed to sell" the goodwill to A and "as consideration for and in full satisfaction of the purchase price of the goodwill" A was to pay eight annas in the rupee in the net profits of the business payable during the life time of P and after him during the life time of his wife and then to their son during his life time. Clause 6 provided that in the event of A entering into partnership or transferring or assigning his business so long as the business was carried on in the name of D.V. & Co.. the partnership, the assignee or the transferee was to pay the share in the profits in the manner provided in cl. (2). A entered into partnership with C, the deed of partnership reciting that the goodwill of the business belonged solely to P which A had "bought" in consideration of his agreeing to pay a share of eight annas in the rupee and that the parties thereto pay five annas four pies share in the profits, by way of purchase price of the goodwill as agreed by P. The firm paid to P's wife, after the death of P, various amounts during the years 1955- 
59. It claimed that those amounts should be deducted in its assessments for those years. The Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected the claim holding that the payments were capital and not revenue payments and the transaction evidenced by the deed of dissolution was one of outright sales. On appeal, the Tribunal held that the payment,constituted only fee or rent for the use of the goodwill so long as it was used and accordingly they were in the nature of revenue expenditure. On reference the High Court answered in favour of the Revenue.
 Allowing the appeal, BELT) : (Sikri C.J. Dissenting) On the facts of the case the transaction was a licence and not, a sale of the goodwill:
 the disbursements in question, therefore, were in the nature of royalty and must be treated as admissible deduction. [232 B] (i) There is no single test of universal application for deciding the question whether in agreement is for payment of price in stipulated instalments or for making annual payment in the nature of income and. therefore, the Court has to look not only into the document relating to the transaction, but also the surrounding circumstances to decide its true nature, the name which the parties give to it being of little consequence.
 216 This does not mean that the legal character of the transaction which is the source of the receipt in question can be ignored and substituted by what the taxing authority considers the substance of the matter. [224 B] Travancore Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. vs. C.I.T., (1966) 62 I.T.R. 566, referred to.
 (ii) One of the tests Courts have applied in distinguishing between capital and revenue expenditure is whether the expenditure in question was for bringing into existence an asset or an advantage of "an enduring nature", and is made "once and for all". It may be payable not necessarily Al at once but even by instalments as against a recurrent expenditure in the nature of operational expenses. The question in such cases would be, is the expenditure the assessee's working expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning or a capital outlay necessary for the acquisition of a property or rights of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on the trade. But the expressions "enduring benefit", and rights of a permanent character are only descriptive and not definitive and are relative in meaning, not synonymous with 'perpetual' or 'everlasting'. The expression "enduring benefit" is thus a relative term not enduring in the sense of its being permanent, but is sufficiently durable depending upon the nature of the terms upon which it can be acquired. So also the the expression "once and for all" which does not mean payment at one time of the whole amount but includes payment of a lump-sum, as distinct from recurrent, distributed in periodic instalments.

 The other test sometimes applied, is payment when it is referrable to fixed capital or capital assets as against payment referrable to circulating capital or stock-in-trade.
 This test also is not capable of being treated as of uniform application. [226 F] Assam Bengal Cement Co. Ltd. v. C.I.T., 27 I.T.R., 34. 46, referred to.
 (iii) Acquisition of the goodwill of a business is, without doubt acquisition of a capital asset, and therefore, its purchase price would be capital expenditure. It would not make any difference whether it is Paid in a lump-sum at one time or in instalments distributed over a specific period.
 Where, however, the transaction is not one for acquisition of the goodwill but, for the right to use it, the expenditure would be a revenue expenditure. [226 H] In Re Ramjidas Jaini & Co., (1945) I.T.R. 430; Kuppuswami v.

 217 (iv) In the present case even though Cl. (2) of the deed of dissolution uses expressions such as "agreed to sell" and "the purchase price of the goodwill," these expressions are not determinative of the exact nature of the transaction or the relationship between the parties arising therefrom.
 Clause (2), no doubt, prescribes the mode and the quantum of payment. But, the duration of payment is indefinite and secondly the amount is indefinite depending upon the rise and fall in the profits of the business. The payment is not related to any lumpsum fixed as the purchase price. But on the contrary it is directly related to and dependent upon whether at all and what profits are made. Further, the document is totally silent as to what is to happen to the goodwill it A, or his partners, if he were to enter into a partnership, cease to carry on the business in the name of D.V. & Co. The transaction thus contains all the grounds given in the case of Travance Sugars and Chemicals Ltd., upon which this Court concluded that such payments could not be treated as capital disbursement, namely, an indefinite period, absence of any expressed lumpsum and payment relat- ing to profits and not being tied up with any fixed sum agreed to as the purchase price_of the capital assets. [230 F-H; 232 B] Travancore Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1966) 62 I.T. R. 566 applied.
 (v) Quite Apart, Cl (6) itself contains indication of the transaction not being an outright purchase of the goodwill.
 If the transaction was an outright purchase of goodwill there was no necessity of Cl. (6) providing for the partnership which A would enter into or his assignee or transferee having to pay the share so long as he or they continued to carry on business in that name. [231 B] Per Sikri, C.J. dissenting.
 (i) Clause (2) of the dissolution deed says what it meant to convey, that is, there is an agreement to sell and sale of the goodwill of the partnership. The word,-, "as consideration for and in full satisfaction of the purchase price of the goodwill" cannot be watered down by any of the subsequent clauses. Further, the deed executed by A and C also recited that A had "bought" the goodwill in consideration of his agreeing 10 pay a share of the profits.
 It is difficult to go against the express wording of the deed when there is no clear clause overriding these words.
 [216 E] (ii) A mode of payment of purchase price of any capital asset cannot convert a Capital payment into a revenue payment in the hands of the vendee. It may be that the mode of payment may affect the character of the receipt in the hands of the vendor. [218 H] (iii) The grounds adopted by this Court in Travancore Sugars and (chemicals Ltd. cannot he regarded as conclusive in a case where there can be no doubt that the capital asset has been sold. [219 B-C] The absence of a clause providing what is to happen if the vendee of the goodwill ceases to carry on the business further reinforces the conclusion that it was an out and out sale. This clause was not inserted because it would be out of place in a case of sale. [219 D] (v) Clause (6) does not have any bearing on the question under consideration. This clause has been inserted in order to safeguard the interest of the vendor who was keen to see that he would get as much as possible for the sale of the goodwill. [219 F] 218 Therefore, on the facts, the goodwill was an asset of an enduring nature. The fact that payment was to be made over a number of years and the nature of a chartered accountant's business lead to this conclusion. [219 F]
