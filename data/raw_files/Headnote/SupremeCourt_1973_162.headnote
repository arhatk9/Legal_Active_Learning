 The appellant, a goldsmith, was convicted under s. 167(81) of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, in that he was in possession of gold bars with foreign markings. The evidence against him consisted of his statement recorded by the customs officer and the evidence of the sub-inspector of police who seized the gold bars from him. In his statement to the customs officer the appellant stated that he was duped by another who left the bag with him and that it was only when he took the bag to his room that he discovered that it contained bars of gold, and that the bag was found in his room.
 The Magistrate framed the charge against the accused after examining the customs officer and the sub-inspector. The sub-inspector was also crossexamined after the charge was framed; but when he was called for further customs officer and the sub-inspector. The sub-inspector was also crossgold bars were found in the room but that the accused was not present when they were seized.
 The trial court found that the statement of the police officer made in further cross examination after framing the charge was untrue and relying on the evidence given by him earlier convicted the appellant. The High Court, in maintaining the conviction, also relied upon the statement of the appellant to the customs officer.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : ( 1 ) If the Court finds the exculpatory part of the statement of the accused to be inherently improbable, there is no reason why the other part of the statement which implicates the accused and which the court sees no reason to disbelieve should not be accepted. In the present case the inculpatory part of statement of the accused to the customs officer is distinct and severable from the exculpatory part.
 It is very difficult to believe the version of the accused that he was duped and the remaining part of the statement clearly implicates him. [1647H; 648G-H; 649A-B] Nishi Kant Jha v. State of Bihar, [1969] 2 S.C.R. 1033, followed.
 (2)As regards the evidence of the sub-inspector there is no cogent reason for disbelieving his earlier version. He changed his version to spite the prosecution because, after his earlier version and before he was called for further cross-examination, he was compulsorily retired as a measure of punishment.
