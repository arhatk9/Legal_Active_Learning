 The appellants took an assignment of a mining lease for extracting coal in respect of 189.76 acres of land. They were anxious to acquire other lands adjacent to the aforesaid area from their respective owners. The transfers in favour of the appellants could not take place without the sanction of the State Government. After protracted corres- pondence and negotiations, the Government agreed to grant the necessary sanction subject to the condition that they took a consolidated lease in respect of the whole additional area at an enhanced rate of royalty. The appellants entered into an agreement with the Government on January 11, 1949 by which the rate of royalty payable to Government was raised from Rs. 5/- to Rs. 10/- per ton. Though no formal lease- deed was executed, the appellants worked the mines with the permission of the Government during the period October 27, 1947, to June 30, 1949 and paid a sum of Rs. 40865/- includ- ing interest, by way of royalty. They paid the aforesaid sum under protest in February-March, 1960. The plaintiffs- appellants brought a suit before Additional District judge for a declaration that they were not bound by the terms of the agreement dated January 11, 1949 and were not liable to pay to Government any sum in excess of that fixed by the lease of 1923 and by the lease of January 21, 1944, and also claimed other consequential reliefs. The suit was decreed on contest by the Government. On appeal by the defendant- respondent, the High Court reversed the judgment and decree of the trial court and dismissed the suit with costs.
 Held, that from the agreement dated January 11, 1949, it is clear that the Governor was in the position of the lessor, 236 hence, even assuming that the Mineral Rules of 1913 had statutory force and applied to the instant case, the Governor having been the grantor of the lease it must be presumed that he decided that the revised terms were in the interest of the State, and, therefore, the revised terms of the lease were binding on the parties; further ultimately the appellants having conceded that the rules were not statutory, the agreement aforesaid was not void.
 The Mineral Concession Rules, 1949 came into effect on October 25, 1949, having no retrospective effect and the agreement in question was finalised in January 1949. There were thus no such Rules in existence which could have been contravened.
 Held, further, that since the payment to the Government was realisable under the terms of the contract which is not vitiated, it could not be said that the State deprived them of any property within the meaning of Art. 31 (1) of the Constitution.
