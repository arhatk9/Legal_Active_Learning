 Under Section 23A of the Indian income Tax Act, 1922, if in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends within the 12 months immediately following the expiry of that previous year are less than the statutory percentage of the total income of that previous year as reduced by the amounts mentioned in cls. (a), (b) and (c) and sub-s. (1), the Income Tax Officer shall make an order that the company shall be liable to pay super-tax at the prescribed rate on the undistributed balance of the total income of the previous year. According to Explanation 2, statutory percentage means 45 per cent of the industrial profits and 60 per cent of nonindustrial profits.The explanation further says that the said percentages should be applied separately with reference to the amounts of profits and gains attributable to the two parts of the company's business as if the said amounts were respectively the total income of the company in relation to each of its parts, the amount of dividends and taxes also being similarly apportioned for purpose of sub-s. (1).
 In the present case 45 per cent of the industrial profits comes to Rs. 1.51 lakhs, while 60 per cent of non-industrial profits comes to Rs. 8.43 lakhs. The company, instead of distributing a sum of Rs. 9.94 lakhs by way of dividends distributed Rs. 4.20 lakhs, equally as profits of the industrial and non-industrial activities leaving aside the profit of Rs. 13.21 lakhs. The income Tax Officer allocated the dividends declared by the company to the industrial and non-industrial segments in the same proportion as the profits of the two segments bore to the total profits of the company and levied additional super-tax under s. 23A on the entire undistributed balance of the total profits available for distribution, namely Rs. 13.21 lakhs. The Order was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
 On appeal, the Appellate Tribunal held that in so far as the profits of the industrial activity were concerned, the company must be deemed to have distributed by way of dividends out of those profits just so much,as would be equal to 45 per cent of such profits and accordingly it allocated the dividend out of industrial and non-industrial profits. On this allocation it came to the conclusion that the company having declared the statutory dividend on its industrial profits, was not liable to pay additional super- tax in so far as these profits were concerned. It, however, upheld the levy of additional super-tax on non-industrial profits.
 The High Court confirmed the Tribunal's view.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The High Court was in error in holding that the profits of the two parts of the company's business should be treated as if they were the total income of the company for all purposes. In taking this view the High Court overlooked the concluding words of Explanation 2 by reason of which the legal fiction has to be limited to its duly appointed purpose. [106 D-E].
 (2) The High Court and the Tribunal were wrong in holding in favour of the assessee. Where a company has a composite business, the first step is to ascertain the distributable profits of the two parts separately. For the purpose of finding out the minimum dividend that the company ought to have distributed, the proper statutory percentage as prescribed by Explanation 2 has to be applied separately to the distributable profits of the two parts, as if the respective profits are the total income of the company in relation to each part of its business. The composite dividend distributed by the company has then to be 94 apportioned between the two parts in the same ratio as the respective profits of the two parts bear to the toal profits of the company. [103H-104B].
 (3)(a) Explanation 2 by its express terms requires that for the purpose of sub-s. (1) the amount of dividends must be "similarly apportioned". [101 E] (b) The word "similar" may generally be said to be a word of ambiguous import in the sense that the mere stipulation in a statute that something should be done similarly is insufficient by itself to signify the degree of similarity with which that thing must be done. The words "similarly apportioned" mean apportioned with reference to the amounts of profits and gain attributable to the two parts of the company's business. The Explanation first refers to an apportionment or splitting up and then provides that the dividends and taxes shalt be similarly apportioned, that is to say, similarly split up. Accordingly, the words "similarly apportioned" have a definite meaning and are not ambiguous. [101G-102 C].
 (c) The word "apportion" is used in Explanation 2 in the sense of "split up" so that "similarly apportioned" means "similarly split up ". The dividends have, therefore, to be split up similarly, i.e. in the same ratio as the industrial and non-industrial profits bear to each other after the total profit is split up in two parts, industrial and non- industrial. [102D-E] ((1) An assignment as a proper portion of the dividends would mean an assignment in the same or similar ratio as the respective profits of the- two segments bear to the total profits of the company. It is not open to the company to split up and apportion the dividends to the Profits of the two segments in such a manner as it finds convenient or thinks fit. The company's freedom to apportion the dividends is conditioned by the ratio which the profits of the two segments bear to the total profits. [102 F-G] The sum of Rs. 4.20 lakhs has to be split up in the same proportion which the respective profits of the two segments bore to the total profits of the company. There is a short- fall in respect of both the segments and accordingly the company would be liable to pay additional super-tax at the rate of 37 per cent on the entire undistributed balance of the distributable profits. [102 H-103 B].
 (4)(a) The language of s. 23A(1) as also of Explanation 2 is clear and distinct and does not yield to more than one reasonable interpretation. The fiction created by the Explanation is expressly limited to the purposes of sub-s.
 (1) and there is no justification for pursuing the fiction to its logical conclusion so as to permit it to operate beyond the limited purpose of sub-s. (1). Under the scheme contained in s. 23A where a company has a composite business it is necessary at the outset to find out the profits attributable to the two parts of its business. The statutory percentages as prescribed by Explanation 2 have then to be applied separately to the profits of the two parts. By reason of the fiction created by Explanation 2, the profits of each part have, for this purpose, and for this purpose alone, to be treated as if they were the total income of that part of the Company's business. By sub-%.
 (1) the company becomes liable to pay additional super-tax if the dividends distributed by it are "less than the statutory percentage of the total income". Explanation 2 creates the fiction that for the purpose of sub-s. (1) the income of the respective parts is to be regarded as the total income of each part so that the statutory percentages can be applied separately to the income of each part. The fiction operates in this limited field and is in terms created for this limited purpose. [105D-106 B].
 (b) The levy of additional super-tax under s.23A(1) is a single levy. The super-tax has to be levied "on the undistributed balance of the total income of the previous year". Sub-section (1) itself clarifies that by these words is meant "total income as reduced by the amounts, if any, referred to in cls. (a), (b) or (c) and the dividends actually distributed, if any." Even if the Income Tax Officer finds that the apportioned dividend in any part of the company's business is less than the dividend that ought to have been 95 declared by application of the statutory percentage, that additional super-tax has to be levied on the whole of the undistributed profits of the company. [106 B-D].
 ARGUMENTS For the appellant :
 1.On a true interpretation of Section 23A(1) and Explanation 2 thereto where the company's profits liable to be distributed as dividend are composite consisting of industrial and non-industrial profits, the Income-tax Officer has first to find out profits attributable to industrial activity and profits attributable to non- industrial activity and ascertain the ratios between the industrial and non industrial profits to the total distributable profit. By the fiction created by explanation 2 he has to treat the profits in each section as if they were the total income of that section and apply the statutory percentage to find out the minimum dividend that must be declared by the company. He has then to dissect the composite dividend declared by the company and apportion the same between the dividend relating to industrial profits and dividend relating to non-industrial profits in the same ratios as the industrial profits bear to the total distributable profits and non-industrial profits bear to the total distributable profits. Thereafter, he has to find out whether the dividends so apportioned between the two parts is below the minimum distributable on the application of the statutory percentage. If he finds that the declared dividend apportioned to any part of the business is below the taxable minimum arrived at by applying the statutory percentage then the Income-tax Officer has to levy additional super tax on the entire undistributed profits, that is to say, on the distributable profits minus the total composite dividend declared by the company.
 2.The levy of additional super-tax u/s. 23A(1) is a single levy and is on the undistributed profits on their entirety and, therefore, where on apportionment of the composite dividend declared by the company the industrial and non- industrial profits, the Income-tax Officer finds that the apportioned dividend in any part of the company's business is less than the dividend that ought to have been declared by application of the statutory percentage the Income-tax Officer has to levy additional super-tax on the entire undistributed profits even though in the other section of the business the declared dividend as apportioned may not be below the minimum that ought to have been distributed by the application of the statutory percentage.
 
3. The fiction created in clause of explanation 2 of Section 23A(1) prescribing that the amounts of profits or gains attributable to two parts of company's business should be- treated as if they were the total income of the company in relation to each of the parts is only for the purpose of applying the statutory percentage which hag to be applied to the total income to find out the dividend liable to be distributed. This fiction cannot be extended for the purpose of deeming the profits of each part as total income for the purpose and levy of additional super-tax as if there were as man total income as there were parts of business profits.
 
4. Even on the interpretation put 'by the High Court and the opinion given by it on the question referred to u/s.
 66(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, the Income-tax Officer would be justified in levying additional super-tax on the entire distributed profit of Rs. 13,21,174 or atleast on Rs.
 12,36,196 which is the amount of non-industrial profits minus the balance of the declared dividend attributable to non industrial profits i.e. Rs. 14,05,310 minus Rs.
 2,69,114.
 For the respondent Section 23A of the Income-tax Act was recast by the Finance Act II of 1957 with effect from 1-4-1957. It is this amended section that is applicable to the case under consideration as it relates to the assessment year 1957-58.
 96 The scope of Explanation 2 would appear to require the following step& to be taken in order to find out whether s.
 23A(1) is applicable in the case of a company whose profits consist partly of industrial activity and partly of non- industrial activity.
 (i) Ascertain the profits relating to each part separately when the company's business consists of partly in manufacture and partly of other activities.
 (ii) Treat the profit of each part as the total income of the company (in order to find out whether the dividend distributed is less than the statutory percentage).
 (iii) Apportion the taxes relating to each part and deduct such tax from the profits of that of the company's business.
 Arrive at the balance of income by deducting the amount covered by item (3) from the amount covered by item (2).
 (iv) Apply the statutory percentage of either 45 per cent or 60 per cent on the balance of income arrived at.
 (v) Find out whether the dividend distributed and apportioned to each part is less than the statutory percentage.
 (vi) If the dividend distributed is less than the statutory percentage, then on the undistributed balance of income of each part less the taxes specified in sub-section (1) and dividend apportioned to this part, additional super-tax to be levied at 37 per cent.
 The expression 'similar' is an ambiguous word. The word apportionment split up. So long as the apportionment is made with the desire to, act as fairly and justly as possible by all parties no uniform mode of apportionment is necessary. In the light of this the assessee company has apportioned the dividend in accordance with the law. There is no other method. of apportionment indicated in the explanation.
 Section 23A(1) is not applicable to that party of the company's profits relating to manufacture. If he follows the provisions of explanation 2 the Income-tax Officer cannot be said to be satisfied that the dividend distributed relating to this part of the company's business is less than the statutory percentage.
 The contention of the Revenue on the other hand is that the dividend should be apportioned in the same proportion in which the industrial profits and non-industrial profits bear to the total income of the company less the taxes specified in cls. (a), (b) and (c) of s. 23A(1).
 It is undeniable that the words used in the latter part of the explanation are ambiguous. They are capable of more meaning than one. The interpretation contended for by the revenue leads to anamolous results. In the circumstances, the construction which favors the assessee and saves it from the penal consequences deserved to be adopted.
