 On 30th November 1955, the Assistant Controllers in the Import and Export Organisation of the Government of India consisted of 47 officers appointed before 1st January 1952 and 76 departmental promotees appointed between Ist January 1952 and 30th November 1955, all the appointments having been made on an ad hoc basis. The Union Public Service Commission objected to the appointments. After some correspondence the Government decided that the appointments made before Ist January 1952, should be regularised and that after that date, there should be 75% direct recruits and 25% departmental promotees. Pursuant to that agreement the Union Public Service Commission called for applications and 57 (75% of 76) Assistant Controllers were selected and appointed by direct recruitment. The Departmental Promotion Committee considered the cases of those who were already working as Assistant Controllers and selected 25 officers out of whom 19 (25% of 76) were appointed. In November 1961, a seniority list of Assistant Controllers was prepared in which the 19 promotees were placed above the direct recruits, and later appointees were arranged on the principle of rotation in the ratio 25 : 75. The effect of that list was to place the petitioners (some of whom were working as Assistant Controllers even before the 57 direct recruits were appointed) after the aforesaid 123 (47 plus 76) appointees. They challenged the list on the following grounds (1)The petitioners were promoted before the new 57 appointments were made, subject to the condition that, they were approved by the Union Public Service Commission and that, therefore, the direct recruits could not be placed over them; (2) the ratio of I : 3 was embodied in the recruitment rules made, by the Government of India under Art. 309 of the Constitution only in 1962, and as the rules were not retrospective,, the seniority list was without any authority of law and was violative of Arts. 14 and 16; (3) the ratio was arbitrary and violative of Art. 14; (4) prior to November 1955, there was only one source of recruitment, namely by departmental promotion, to the cadre of Assistant Controllers, and therefore, the decision to relate back the seniority of the direct recruits to the period between Ist January 1952 and 30th November 1955, was based on 'reservation for those who were not then in existence, and amounted to carrying forward of vacancies which was unconstitutional.
 
HELD : (1) The petitioners were promoted under orders which stated that their appointments were made on an ad interim basis pending selection of the officers by the Union Public Service Commission. In the context in which the petitioners were appointed, it was not the, intention of the Government that they were to be -appointed subject to the approval of the Union Public Service Commission. The intention 30 of the Government on the contrary was that as the selection to the posts was impending through the usual channel of the Union Public Service Commission from all sources of recruitment, the petitioners should only be promoted on an ad hoc basis. Therefore, the petitioners had no right to the posts of Assistant Controllers. [35 B-E] (2)(a) The recruitment to the 76 posts was made from two sources with different qualifications, namely, (i) by promotion from the subordinate staff and (ii) by direct recruitment. Since the preferential treatment of one source was based on the differences between the two sources and the differences have a reasonable relation to the nature of the office to which recruitment was made, the said 'recruitment could legitimately be sustained on the basis of a valid classification. [33 H; 35 If] (b)Where the recruitment to a cadre was from two sources, a rotational system would not violate the principle of equal opportunity enshrined in Art. 16(1). [36 A-B] Mervyn Coutinho v. The Collector of Customs, Bombay, [1966] INSC 46; [1966] 3 S.C.R. 600, followed.
 (3)When the recruitment to certain posts is from different sources, what ratio would be adequate and equitable would depend upon the circumstances of each case and the requirements and needs of a particular post. Nothing was suggested in the present case to show that the ratio of 3 :
 I was flagrant or unreasonable. [36 C] (4)In a case where a service is divided into two parts and there are two sources of recruitment, one by promotion and the other by direct recruitment, there is no question of carrying anything forward from year to year in the matter of annual intake. when the vacancies that arose between 1952 and 1955 were filled up subsequently, it was not a case of vacancies being carried forward to the subsequent year or years. All that happened was, that certain vacancies had arisen and for certain reasons they were not permanently filled up, but some ad hoc appointments were made in regard thereto and subsequently, they were filled up by permanent appointments.
