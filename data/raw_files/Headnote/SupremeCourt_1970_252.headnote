 The appellant purchased machineries etc. from the Eastern Coal Co. Ltd. and also took on lease the land on which the buildings stood. One of ,the terms of the lease which was dated May 17, 1946 was that royalty would be paid by the appellant at the rate of Re. 1/- per ton on despatches of coke. In 1950 another arrangement was arrived at by which royalty on breeze coke was to be paid at 2 As. per ton. In December 1951, .according to the appellant, another arrangement was made by which the royalty on hard coke was reduced to 8 As. per ton The Eastern Coal Co. sold the collieries to Respondent no. 1 with effect from January 1, 1955. Respondent no. 1 claimed royalty on all despatches of coke including breeze coke at the rate of Re. 1 per ton.
 The appellant paid only at the rate of 8 As. per ton on hard coke and 2 As. per ton on breeze coke. Respondent no. 1 filed a suit for the balance at the rate ,,of Re. 1 per ton. The trial court held that document Exp. A-4 on which the appellant relied to prove the agreed reduction of rates was admissible in evidence although not registered, and dismissed the suit. The High Court did not consider the question of the admissibility of Ex. A-4 but decreed the suit on the finding that the appellant had failed to prove that the reduction in the rate of royalty had been. given effect to from July 1952 as claimed. In appeal by certificate to this Court, 
HELD : Even on the assumption that a mutual arrangement or agreement as evidenced by Ex A-4 was arrived at between the appellant and the Eastern Coal Co. Ltd. it could not be accepted that any reduction in royalty could have been effected by means of Exh. A-4 which had not been registered under the provisions of the Indian Registration Act. It is well settled that a document which varies the essential terms of the existing registered lease such as the amount of rent, must be registered. [234 E-F] Durga Prasad Singh v.
