 The petitioners in the writ petitions were medical graduates who applied for admission to the Post-graduate course in the Medical College, Srinagar for the semester beginning in July 1970, appeared for an entrance test but the result was not declared officially. They contended in their writ petitions that the refusal of the Government to admit any student at all for the Post-Graduate course for the three semesters which commenced in July 1980, November 1980 and July 1981 was violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution, besides being mala fide.
 The State Government contested the writ petitions contending that the rules which were in operation in July, 1980 governing admission to the Post-Graduate Medical Course, were prejudicial to the interests of the students of Jammu Medical College and were to an extent discriminatory and that was why no admissions were made to the July 1980 semester, that the amendment of the rules of admission were initiated so as to bring them in conformity with the requirements of the Constitution, and that this took a long period of 18 months.
 Dismissing the writ petitions, 345 ^ 
 HELD : There is no violation of any of the fundamental rights of the petitioners nor is the action of the State authorities arbitrary or mala fide. [348C] Mala fides cannot be assumed while dealing with a question which has far-reaching consequences. No specific facts have been alleged on the basis of which a finding can be recorded that the decision not to admit any student at all for three consecutive semesters was actuated by a mala fide intention on the part of the State Government. There is only a bald assertion in the writ petitions that a total ban was placed on admission to the three consecutive semesters in order to favour some persons. [347H-348A] In the instant case, until the year 1973 there was only one Medical College in the State of Jammu & Kashmir, which was at Srinagar. The Medical College at Jammu was started in 1973. The Jammu Medical College was affiliated to the Jammu University while the Srinagar Medical College was affiliated to Kashmir University. The statutes of Jammu University did not correspond to the statutes of the Kashmir University for admission to the Post-graduate course, thereby causing discrimination in favour of those fulfilling the requirements under the statutes of the Kashmir University as against those eligible under the statutes of the Jammu University. That was why, the State Government had to take action for curing the defects which were inherent in the prevailing procedure for selection to the Post-Graduate Medical Course in the two medical colleges. The Kashmir University statute was amended so as to introduce uniformity in the rules of admission. According to clause 3 of the 1980 Notice of Admission, it was necessary for the candidates to have completed one year's Compulsory House Job in the concerned speciality, as provided in the statutes of the Kashmir University. Under the amended provisions which came into force in 1981 candidates had to complete one years's House Job in a recognised institution in the concerned subject or six months' House Job in the concerned subject and six months' House Job in an allied subject. The amended rule conforms to the rule which prevailed in other parts of the country and was in accordance with recommendations of the Medical Council of India. [347C-G]
