 The appellant landlord made an application under s. 13 of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 for the respondent's eviction from certain premises on the ground that the -rent 'for the premises from October 1959 to June 1961 had -not been paid. On the first day of hearing the respondent appeared and tendered part of the rent. He claimed that he had made two deposits in the court of the Senior Sub-Judge under s. 31 of the East Punjab Relief of Indebtedness Act, 1934 and that this was a valid tender of the balance rent to the landlord. The Rent Controller decided that the respondent was not in default and the appellate authority as well as the High Court took the same view.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The deposit under s. 31 of the Relief of Indebtedness Act did not save the tenant from the consequences of the default as contemplated by s. 13 of the Urban Rent Restriction Act. [70 F] Section 31 is intended to operate between debtors and creditors where difficulty in making the payment, either wholly or partly, may arise in the debtor wishes to save himself from interest which is running. The Act is not intended to operate between landlords and tenants; nor is the Court of the Senior Sub-Judge a clearing house for rent.
 Although the general words "any person who, owes money" may appear to cover the case of a tenant, looking at the Act as a whole, the phrase must be read to cover cases of debtors and creditors between whom the-re is an agreement for payment of interest because the deposit is intended to stop interest from running. No interest is agreed to be paid by tenants, at any rate, nor ordinarily, and therefore, the section cannot be said to cover a case between a landlord and a tenant. [69 F-H]
