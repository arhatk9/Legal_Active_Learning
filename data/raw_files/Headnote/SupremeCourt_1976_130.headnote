 A new cadre of the Indian Administrative Services was constituted for Delhi and Himachal Pradesh, and recruitment to it was made directly without following the normal method prescribed by Rule 4(1) of the I.A.S. (Recruitment) Rules, 1954. These Rules were amended to provide for a joint cadre for the Union Territories and the North East Frontier Agency, and the Central Government formulated a scheme for extending the Delhi-Himachal Pradesh Cadre to all the Union Territories by absorbing its officers and appointing officers from the Indian Frontier Administrative Service and all other Union Territories initially. The joint cadre was brought into existence by the Central Government's orders notified under See. 3(1) of the l.A.S. (Cadre) Rules, 1954, published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary. The creation of the new joint cadre and the appointment of some of the respondents thereto. were challenged in the High Court on the ground that they were contrary to Art. 312 of the Constitution and the All India Services Act, 1951, as the joint cadre was not common to the Union and the States inasmuch as a Union Territory was not a State, and the recruitment of the respondents concerned, was illegal. The High Court quashed the Central Government's orders and the scheme for the formation of a joint cadre of the T.A.S. and held that the creation of the Delhi Himachal Pradesh Cadre was also ultra vires the Constitution. The question of law which came up before this court was whether Union Territories are 'States' for the purpose of art. 312 of the Constitution, and the all India Service Rules, 1951 ? Allowing the appeals the Court, ^ 
 HELD : Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act. 1897, provides inter alia, that the expression 'State' shall mean "a state specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution and shall include a Union Terirtory." By virtue of Article 372-A of the Constitution. which was inserted by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956 because of the fact that the power of adaptation under article 372(2) had come to an end. it was that definition of the expression 'State' which had effect from the 1st day of November, 1956, and the Constitution expressly provided that it could not be questioned in any court of law. It was a special provision which was meant to serve the purpose of making the Seventh Amendment Act workable. Article 372-A thus gave a fresh power under article 372(2). As from November 1, 1956 the President therefore had the power to adapt the laws for the purpose of bringing the provisions of any law in force in India in accord with the provisions of the Constitution. It was under that power that the President issued the Adaptation of Laws (No. 1) Order, 1956, which substituted the new clause (58) in section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, referred to above. The High Court went wrong in taking a contrary view and in holding that "Union Territories" were not "States" [168G, 169AG, 171D] Management of Advance Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shri Gurudasmal & Ors., [1970] INSC 51; [1970] 3 S.C.R. 881, referred to.
