 The Central Government by an order dated October 27, 1967, accepted substantially the recommendations of the Wage Board constituted under S. 9 of the Working Journalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1955, in respect of wages etc. of working journalists. The Press Trust of India (P.T.I.) and the Indian National Press Ltd., filed writ petitions challenging the order of the Government accepting the recommendations. The P.T.I. con- tended that, (1) it was discriminated against both in respect of the classification and in the fixation of wages;
 (2) there was a violation of s. 10 of the Act as the Wage Board had not taken into consideration its capacity to pay;
 and (3) the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in awarding to the employees wages higher than what were demanded.
 Allowing the writ petition of the P.T.I. and dismissing that of the Indian National Press.
 
HELD:-The order of the Central Government, in so far as the P.T.I. is concernedis struck down and the P.T.r.
 directed to pay the wages agreed to between the P.T.I. and its employees" from the date when wages were payable according to the recommendation of the Wage Board, till the wages are refixed by the Central Government on the recommendations of another Wage Board. No case was made out by the Indian National Press that it had no capacity to meet the wage increase, particularly when it had been placed in the appropriate class in which it should have been placed on the basis of its gross profits. [518 D; H] (1)(a) The definition of 'newspaper establishment' cannot be drawn on for the purposes of justifying only one classification of all the establishment included in that definition. Obviously newspapers and. news agencies have different functions. They have different sources of revenue and the services rendered by each are different. Also, the broad classification may again be subdivided and sub- classified according to the capacity of each of the categories. [509 A-c] (b)The Wage Board in its recommendations has stated that for the purposes of fixation of Wages for working journalists, newspapers and news agencies should be classified in the manner therein provided and that such classification should be based on the gross revenues for the accounting years 1963, 1964 and 1965,. On this basis newspapers and news agencies have been divided into 7 classes class 11 containing establishments with gross revenue between Rs. 100 and Rs. 200 lakhs, and Class III between Rs. 5.0 and Rs. 100 lakhs. [509 D] (c)The classification is based on intelligible differential namely, the capacity of each news agency to pay; and between News papers and news agencies, on the nature of the service rendered, the sources of income and the manner in which the service is rendered. The criteria for classification also bears a rational relationship to the object to be achieved, namely, wages to be fixed. [510 G] (d)But it is. well established that even where legislative action or any action taken is under any law against a single individual of things or several individual 500 persons or things where no reasonable basis for classification may appear on the face of it or deducible from the surrounding circumstances, that action is liable to be struck down as an instance of discrimination.

 (e)The P.T.I. has been placed in the category of Class II instead of class III, to which it admittedly belongs. There is however, no indication as to what extent the Wage Board has considered the relevant materials either of the Press Commission, or in an award in the industrial dispute between the P.T.I. and their workmen, and various other circumstances and representations made by the P.T.I., such as its inability to increase subscriptions and want of legal means to compel any increase. Whether the financial potentiality of the P.T.I. was considered as the basis for including it in class 11 category instead of in class III category, contrary to the criteria prescribed by the Wage Board itself, is also not evident from the recommendations of the Board. AR that is discernible is that because the P.T.I. has the status of a national news agency, which caters even for top class papers, it should be placed in class II category. How the position of the P.T.I. as a national news agency has any relevance to the criteria relatable to its gross revenue has not been specified, nor is it ascertainable as to how the catering to the top class papers would increase its gross revenue. The P.T.I. was required to continue in class 11 as long as it satisfies the criteria for class III, namely, so long as its gross revenue is less than Rs. 100 lakhs. This is arbitrary and singles out the P.T.I. for discrimination. [513 D-F] (2)(a) The yield from subscriptions for the years 1971, 1972 and 1973 on which the respondents relied, are not relevant for fixation of wages in 1967, though they may justify a wage revision by another Board. [514 C-D] (b)The Wage Board itself had stated that Rs. 6.78 lakhs per annum would be the recurring financial burden which would have to be borne by the P.T.I. on account of the implementation of its final proposals. It could not be con, tended by the respondents that this amount is the estimated burden on the basis of implementation of the recommendations of the Wage Board for both working Journalists and non- working journalists, and that as far as working journalists are concerned, the burden will amount to only Rs. 3.48 lakhs which is less than the average profit of Rs. 3.67 lakhs. No doubt the wage increases will have to be met from the revenue and only thereafter the profits can be computed.
 But whether the burden of Rs. 6.78 lakh is in respect of the working journalists or in respect of both the working and non working journalists, it is none the less the burden which the P.T.I. has to bear. In judging the financial capacity of the employer one has to look at the burden as a.
 whole. It cannot be said that the establishment should pay the working journalists first the recommended wages and utilize whatever balance remains for payment to the non- working journalists irrespective of whether they can be paid the wage recommended or not. because, that is not what is envisaged in the term capacity to pay. The Wage Board, while recognizing that the burden was heavy, assumed without any discussion that the P.T.I. could increase its subscription and tighten its Organization. But assumptions are not enough. What the Act says is, ascertain the financial capacity and fix the wages according to that capacity. [514 G-Hffi 515 B-C] Express News papers (P) Ltd. & Anr. v. The Union of India and Ors. (1959) S.C.R. 12, followed.
 (3)The impugned order of the Central Government also suffers from the infirmity that it has accepted the recommendations of the Wage Board when it has prescribed a wage higher than that asked for by the employees of the P.T.I. Section 10 of the Act confers a right of representation on both employers and employees and has prescribed a procedure for calling upon the newspaper establishment and working journalists and other persons interested in the fixation or revision of wages for working Journalists to make representations and there.after it is Incumbent on the Board to take into account those representations and examine the material placed before it in the light of those representations for 501 A making its recommendations. Any infringement of this procedural safeguard would affect its recommendations. The employers could only meet the claim of the employees, but could not meet the recommendation for a wage higher than that asked for. A law providing reasonable restrictions in the exercise of the right conferred by Art. 19 may contain substantive provisions as well as procedural provisions.
 The reasonableness of the restriction whether substantively or procedurally has to be judged from the point of view of the right that has been in fact restricted. [517 F-H] In the present case, the recommendations being in excess of what the employees themselves demanded and being beyond the financial capacity of the establishment, are unreasonable.
 The order of the Central Government, in so far as the P.T.I.
 is concerned, is violative of their fundamental rights and must be struck down.
 Dr. N. B. Khare v. The State of Delhi, [1950] S.C.R. 521 followed.
 (4)The petitions were originally filed with two affected persons as the second Petitioner in each of the writs. On the death of one and withdrawal of the other, petitions were filed to substitute a share holder of the 1st petitioner in each writ, as the 2nd petitioner. A shareholder can challenge the order if the restriction on his right under Art.19(1)(f) is unreasonable. If the impugned order places a heavy burden on the resources of the company or the wage has been fixed without taking into consideration the capacity to pay, or where a wage higher than what the Journalists asked for is fixed without hearing the employer, then that burden will affect the shareholders. In the interests of justice, balance of convenience and preventing the prolonging of litigation the Court is therefore, justified in granting the substitution of petitioners prayed tot in the petitions.
