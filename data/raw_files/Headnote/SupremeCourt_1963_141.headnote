 The General Manager of a Railway invited tenders for the supply of jaggery to the railway grain shops. Paragraph 2 of the tender set out the quantity required and described dates of delivery. There was a note in that para that "the Administration reserved the right to cancel the contract at any stage during the tenure of the contract without calling up the outstanding on the unexpired portion of the contract.
 " Under para 8 the successful tenderer was required to pay security deposit towards proper fulfillment of the contract.
 Paragraph 9 stated that a formal order for supply would be placed after the security deposit referred to in para 8 was made. The respondent submitted his tender for the supply of 14000 maunds as mentioned in the tender, and by the letter dated January 29, 1948, the Deputy General Manager accepted the tender stating that the official order would be placed on the respondent on receipt of the remittance of security.
 In his letter dated February 16, 1948, the Deputy General Manager reiterated the acceptance of the tender subject to the respondents' acceptance of the terms and conditions printed on the reverse of that letter, under which 3500 maunds each were to be delivered on March 1, 775 March 22, April 5 and April 21, 1948 respectively. At the end of the terms and conditions was a note that the adminis- tration reserved the right to cancel the contract at any stage during the tenure of the contract without calling upon the outstanding on the unexpired portion of the contract.
 By his letter dated March 8, 1948, the Deputy General Manager informed the respondent that the balance quantity of jaggery outstanding on date against the order dated February 16, 1948, be treated as cancelled and the contract closed.
 In the suit instituted by the respondent for the recovery of damages resulting from breach of contract, the appellant relied, by way of defence, on the stipulation in the contract that the appellant was at livery to terminate the contract at any stage.
 Held that, on the true construction of the contract, the condition mentioned in the note 2 of the tender or in the letter dated February 16, 1948 referred to a right in the appellant to cancel the agreement for such supply of jaggery about which no formal order had been passed by the Deputy General Manager with the respondent and did not apply to such supplies of jaggery about which a formal order had been placed specifying definite amount of jaggery to be supplied and the definite date or definite short period for its actual delivery. Once the order was placed for such supply on such dates, that order amounted to a binding contract making it incumbent on the respondent to supply jaggery in accordance with the terms of the order and also making it incumbent on the Deputy General Manager to accept the jaggery delivered in pursuance of that order.
