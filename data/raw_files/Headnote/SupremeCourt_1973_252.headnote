 Under the Punjab Professions, Trades, Callings and Employment Taxation Act, 1956, a professional tax on a graded scale, subject to a maximum of Rs. 250 per annum, had been and was being collected by the State of Haryana. The Panchayat Samiti. Ballabgarh, in Haryana. issued a notice that it intended to levy professional tax at the maximum rate of Rs. 200 per annum according to the Scheduled specified under the Gram Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads Act. 1961. The appellants, in writ petitions in the High Court, contended that the imposition was in violation of Article 276 of the Constitution in that the maximum limit of Rs. 250/- mentioned in the Article applies to the totality of the tax recovered by all the authorities mentioned in the Article taken together. The High Court dismissed the petitions.
 Dismissing the appeals to this Court, 
HELD : The High Court was right in reaching the conclusion that the State as well as the authorities mentioned in the Article can each impose tax up to a limit of Rs. 250. [830 G-H] (1)The power of the State to levy the tax is derived from Entry 60 of List II of the VII Schedule to the Constitution dealing with taxes on professions, trades, callings and employments. The State Legislature is therefore, competent to legislate and levy taxes on professions. trades and employments and may also by law, confer a similar authority on a local authority. [828 F] (2) A tax on profession can be imposed if a person carries on a professions. Such atax on profession is irrespective of the question of income. [829 G] (3) The words in the Article that the total amount payable to the State or to any one Municipality, District Board.
 Local Board or local authority cannot mean that the word 'or' is used in a conjunctive sense as a substitute for the word 'and'. This is clear from the proviso to Article 276(2) which provides that if before the commencement of the Constitution any State or any, authority had imposed a tax earning the limit of Rs. 250 such tax may continue; and this indicates that both can tax separately to the limit imposed by the Article. [830 B] (4)The words 'any one person' in the Article are used in juxtaposition with any one municipality etc. One and the same person may be engaged in more than one of the items suggested in Art. 276 and there may be imposition of tax on more than one item. The word 'total' relates to am authority levying various taxes and not to all authorities put together. [830 D] (5)If the total of the taxes should not exceed Rs. 250/- as contended by the appellant it will mean that if a person is paying professional tax of Rs. 150 to the State the local authority can impose on him a similar tax only upto the balance of Rs. 100. This would lead to the anomalous consequences, namely (a) one of the authorities will have to tax persons with lower incomes while those with higher incomes will escape; and (b) if one authority will impose a tax of the balance sum left after deducting the tax imposed by the State, all the other authorities may not impose the taxes, [830 F] 828
