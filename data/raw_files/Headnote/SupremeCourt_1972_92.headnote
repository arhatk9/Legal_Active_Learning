 The appellant and another, Loco employees of the Railway, were in joint occupation of certain quarters consisting of a bed.-room and a kitchen. 'They were charged with offences under ss. 25 and 26 of ',he Indian Arms Act, 1959. The trial court convicted both the accused. The first appellate Court convicted the appellant but acquitted the other accused. In revision by the appellant, the High Court set aside his conviction under s. 26, but upheld his conviction under s. 25, on the basis that a gun was found inside the kitchen-room in which the appellant concealed himself bolting the room from inside, and that the appellant was the sole occupant of that room at the time when the police raided the premises.
 Allowing the appeal 'to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The Courts below had not considered the prosecution 'evidence in the light of the gross exaggeration which had been introduced about the door of the kitchen-room having been bolted or chained from inside by the appellant.
 Once that vital fact is disbelieved the entire story of the appellate having conceived himself in that room had to be rejected. [953 C-E] (2) On the evidence, the quarters must be held to be in the joint possession of both the accused. Under s. 35 of the Act which was never considered by the courts below where any arms or ammunition are or is round in any premises in he joint occupation or under the joint control of several persons, each of such persons in respect of whom there is reason to believe that he was aware of the existence of the arms and ,ammunition in the premises unless the contrary is proved will be liable for the offence under s. 25(1) of being in possession of an unlicensed fire arm. But, in the present case the prosecution had not established the essential ingredients of the offence in the light of the provisions of s. 3 5. As the gun was concealed in such a manner that it was not visible to the naked eye, it could not be urged that when the appellant was using the kitchen he would be aware of its existence in that room. [953 F-H] (3) In cases of this nature involving the liberty and career of a citizen _great care and attention should be devoted by the courts to all questions or. law and fact. [954 A-B]
