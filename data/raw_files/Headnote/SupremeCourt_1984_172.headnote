 The respondent-assessee, a dealer in tractors, motor- cycles and spare-parts etc., while filing its quarterly returns, claimed deduction in respect of tax free goods of Rs. 26, 572.82 being the sale proceeds of belt pulley attachment sold along with the tractor or separately by itself from its yearly gross turn over of Rs. 21,65,983.91 for the assessment year 1965-66 on the ground that the belt pulley attachment should be treated as an agricultural implement and therefore it is exempted from the levy of sales tax under Entry 34 of Schedule B to the Punjab General Sales Tax Act (the Act for short). The assessing authority rejected the claim on the ground that the belt pulley attachment could not be treated as a composite part of the tractor nor can it be treated as an agricultural implement and it was not one of the tax free goods as contemplated by Entry 34. The respondent-assessee preferred an appeal to the appellate authority against the order of the assessing authority. The appellate authority allowed the appeal holding that the sales of belt pulley attachment amounting to Rs. 26, 572. 82 p. was of tax free goods under Sec. 5 (2) (a) (i) of the Act and that amount should be deducted from the gross turnover of the assessee. But, the Joint Excise and Taxation Commissioner suo moto quashed the order of the appellate authority and restored that of the assessing authority. In revision, Sales Tax Tribunal confirmed the decision of the Taxation Commissioner. Thereupon the respondent-assessee moved the High Court which held that the belt pulley attachment falls within the meaning of the expression agricultural implement since it increases the utility of a tractor for an agricultural operation. Hence this appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : (1) Belt pulley means a pulley over which a belt may pass to transmit power to other part of the machine. It is indeed true that the belt pulley when used in a tractor may increase the utility of the tractor for agricultural operations but that by itself does not lead to the inevitable conclusion that belt pulley attachment is an agricultural implement. It is not only used in a tractor but it is also used in various other machines such as motor car engines, water pumps, threshers etc. Therefore, when sold as a spare 772 part it cannot by itself become an agricultural implement.
 To comprehend it in the generic term "agricultural implement," the court would have to stretch the language to impermissible limit of breaking it.
 [773 H, 774 A-G] In the instant case, the assessee is selling belt pulley attachment as spare part which can be used in many machines. Therefore, the belt pulley attachment which can be used in various mechanical appliances or devices by itself cannot be said to be an agricultural implement.
