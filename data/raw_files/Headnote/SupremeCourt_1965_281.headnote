 The appellant-mills, was situate outside the municipal limits of Saharampur and was exporting a large quality of cloth to various places in India. Its lorries loaded with bales first entered the municipal limits at some place near the appellant's premise; and then proceeded towards the railway station where they were unloaded without any sorting or change of bulk. Before reaching the station the lorries had-to pass-out of the municipal barrier near the station, which was meant to serve as an import barrier for goods coming into the municipality from the railway station and as an export barrier for goods going outside the municipality. But the barrier was not placed exactly where the municipal limits and it was some distance ins de the municipal limits, which were beyond the railway station.
 Therefore.. after the bales were unloaded at the railway station, they remained within the municipal limits till they were taken away by rail to destinations for which they were booked.
 Under r. 8(a) of the Rules for Tolls as In 1949, which were applicable in the present case, if a person in charge of a lorry laden with taxable goods entering the municipal limits, declared that they were meant for immediate export from the municipal limits without sorting or change of bulk, he was entitled to a transit pass which had to be presented within half an hour at the export barrier and no toll tax would have to be paid. The appellant claimed that it was entitled to get the transit pass under the rule, but the respondent did not agree. The appellant, therefore, paid the toll tax under protest and filed a writ petition in the High Court, but it was dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that all that the rule required in order to entitle it to a transit pass and escape the toll tax, was, that is lorries should go out of the export barrier even though the goods may still be within municipal limits.
 
HELD (Per Chief Justice, Wanchoo., Ramaswami and Satyanarayana Raju, JJ) : The intention of the rule was that lorries, after entering the municipal limits, were to pass out of the same with the leas, possible delay. Before a person could claim the benefit of the rule, it was neces sary to satisfy the condtion that the lorry reached the export barrier within the time limited by the rule and with the goods in the same condition in which they were when the lorry entered the municipal area. The half an hour's period provided in the rule was for the purpose of checking at the export barrier that the lorry passed out of the municipal area as soon as possible. Therefore, where was not in dispute that the goods did not go out of the municipal limits even after passing the export barrier, and were unloaded at the railway station which was 960 within the municipal limits, they would not be entitled to a transit pass. [964 E-F, H; 965 A-B] The crucial words in the rule are "meant for immediate export from such limits without sorting and change of bulk." The rule contemplates that the goods must leave the municipal limits as soon as possible without sorting or change of bulk, that is, in the same vehicle and their passing through the export barrier is taken to show that they are going out of the municipal limits. However, as a barrier is not necessarily at the end of the municipal limits, for its placing depends upon convenience, the reasonable interpretation of the rule is that where the municipal limits extend for some distance beyond the export barrier, the goods must go out of the municipal limits after passing the export barrier. if they are to be entitled to a transit pass. But it does not follow from the fact that the goods have arrived at the export barrier within half an hour from the time of the issue of a transit pass and have passed the export barrier, that the goods are "meant for immediate export from municipal limits" if the goods are not sent out of the municipal limits after crossing the export barrier and the unloaded within the municipal limits. [963 G-H; 964 A, B, D-E] Per Hidayatullah, J. (dissenting) : There was a declaration by the appellant that the goods imported into the municipal limits were meant for immediate export from such limits without sorting and change of bulk and the goods did pass the export barrier without any sorting or change of bulk.
 They were unloaded on the railway premises and the trucks returned empty. The appellant had thus complied with all the conditions of the rule. No doubt, some time has to pass before the goods are booked and loaded on trains and during that time the goods did lie within the municipal limits; but as the goods have passed the export barrier and could not re-enter without passing through it as an import barrier, they should merit a release form tolls. [967 F-H] The municipality imposes its taxes only when there is entry into the town from the railway yard. The municipality by its own arrangement, regards the station yard as being outside its export barrier. If the same goods are brought in again they will bear tax at the barrier as an import barrier and no plea will be heard that the goods had paid toll at the other end and that they were within the municipal limits all the time. The intention of the rule is to free from tolls goods in transit, on proof that they have been exported from the municipal limits. The rule must be applied in a fair and equitable manner and one of the cardinal principles of law is that the law does not expect, nor does it compel, a man to do that which he cannot possibly perform. The word "immediately" must be, in the circumstances, understood as 'allowing a reasonable time for export. [968 A-C; 969 A-B] Central India Spinning and Weaving and Manufacturing Co.
