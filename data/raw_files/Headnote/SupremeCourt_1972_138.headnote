 M who who was accused of an offence under S. 302 of the, Indian Penal Code gave information to the Police on September 16, 1966 during the course of investigation of that offence that the appellant had given him a revolver which he had kept with one C at village Karoonda in the State AA Rajasthan. On that information the revolver was seized from C the next day namely September 17, 1966. The police at Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh applied for Sanction under S. 39 of the Art to prosecute the appellant for the offence uader S. 25 (a) of the Act. The Sanction stated that the appellant had "allegedly been found in possession of and having under his control one revolver without a valid licence at Neemuch Police Station, Neemuch on 17-9-1966." The Megistrate at Neemuch framed a charge against the appellant under s. 25(a) of the Indian Arms Act 1959 on the basis that be was found in possession of the revolver on or before 17-9-196,6.
 The appellant filed a revision petition before the, sessions judge which was rejected The High Court rejected a further revision petition. In appeal by special leave before dos Court the question that fell for consideration were (1) whether on the facts alleged the appellant could be said to be in possession of the revolver for being changed with in offence under SI 25(a) of the Act : and (ii) whether the charge went Leyond the sanction.
 Held:(i) The possession of a fire arm under the Arms Act must have, firstly, the element of consciousness or knowledged of that possession in the person charged with such offence and secondly, where he has not the actual physical possession, he has nonetheless a power or control over that weapon so that his possession thereon continues desire physical possession being in someone else. if this were not so, then :an owner of a house who leaves an unlicenced gun in that house but is not present when it was recovered by the police can plead that he was not in possession of it even though he had himself consciously kept it three when he went out. Similarly. if he goes out of the house during the day and in the meantime someone conreals a pistol in his house and during his absence the notice arrives and discovers the pistol he cannot be charged with the offence unless it c,n be shown that he had knowledge of the weapon being placed in his house. And vet again if a gun or firearm is given to his servant in the house o clean it, though the physical no session is with him nevertheless possession ,of it will be that of the owner. [511 G-512 BI In any disputed question of possession, specific facts admitted or proved will alone establish the existence of the de facto relation of control or the dominion of the person over it necessary to determine whether that person was or was not in possession of the thing in question. [512 D] On the above view the charge that the appellant was in po- ssession of the revolver on 17-9-1966 did not suffer from any defect particularly 509 when he was definitely informed in that charge that he had control over the revolver. However in view of the forms of the charge given in the Schedule to the Code of criminal Procedure the charge should be amended to read 'on or about 17-9-1966 instead of 'on or before'. [511 E_G] (ii) under the Arms Act all that is required for sanction under s. 39 is that the person to be prosecuted was found to be in possession of the firearm, the date at dates on which he was so found in possession and the possession of the firearm was without a valid licence. As all the ,elements were contained in the sanction in the precent case it was not an illegal sanction nor could it be said that the charge travelled beyond the sanction. [513 E-F] Gokak Chand v.
