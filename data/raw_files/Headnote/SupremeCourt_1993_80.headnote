 The appellant Union demanded payment of dearness allowance to the daily-rated workmen employed in the factory of the respondent at the same rate as was being paid to the monthly-rated employees with effect from 1.1.1964. Ile matter was placed before the Conciliation Officer on 15.11.1965 and thereafter before the Conciliation Board. On 15.3.1967 the Conciliation Board submitted its failure report On 26.4.1968 the appellant-Union submitted a Memorandum to the Government reiterating the said demand and claiming the benefit from 15.11.1965. The Government referred the dispute to the Industrial Tribunal.
 The Respondent-employer filed a Writ Petition challenging the validity of the order of reference and the High Court set aside the order of reference by consent without prejudice to the rights of the Government for making a fresh reference.
 On March 19,1973 the appellant-Union submitted a demand claiming the same relief with effect from 15.11.1965. The Government made a reference accordingly to the Industrial Tribunal on 26.3.1973. By its Award dated 3.1.1977 the Tribunal directed the Respondent-employer to make payment of D.A. at the rate of 15% of the revised textile rate with effect from 1.1.1968.
 The Respondent filed a Writ Petition before the High Court challenging the Tribunal's Award. Unable to succeed before a Single Judge, 1051 Respondent-preferred an appeal and the Division Bench held that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to award relief to the workmen with effect from a date prior to the date on which the dispute was raised. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant-union preferred the present appeal.
 On behalf of the appellant-Union it was contended that since it has been agitating for grant of D.A. of daily-rated workmen right from Nov. 1965, the Tribunal was justified in awarding the same with effect from 1.4.1968.
 The Respondent contended that the demand dated 26.4 1968 was never submitted to the Management, but was made direct to the Government which made a reference and the same was set aside by the High Court; and that a fresh dispute was raised on 193.73 and so the relief was rightly restricted by the High Court to be effective only from that date viz. 193.73.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1. The Industrial Tribunal/Labour Court is supposed to be a substitute forum to the Civil Court. Broadly speaking, the relief which the Civil Court could grant in an industrial dispute can be granted by the Industrial Tribunal/Labour Court. Indeed the Industrial Tribunal/Labour Court is not bound by the Technical rules of procedure which bind the Civil Court. Therefore it cannot be said that the Industrial Tribunal or for that matter a Labour Court has no jurisdiction to grant relief from a date anterior to the date on which the dispute is raised.
 It is one thing to say that the Tribunal has no power to grant such relief and it is an altogether different thing to say that in a given case it ought not to grant such relief.
 Whether in a given case relief should be granted with effect from a date anterior to the date of raising the dispute is a matter for the Tribunal to decide in the facts and circumstances of that case.

2. The demand raised on 193.73 was not a fresh demand. It was reiteration of the demand raised its far back as November 1965. It is lot 1052 suggested that the demand raised in November 1965 was not raised before, or submitted to the Management. Even otherwise, the demand raised on 193.73 - assuming that it was a fresh demand was for extending the said benefit with effect from an anterior date namely, 15.11.1965. It was the said demand which was referred by the Government to the Tribunal. There is no reason why the Tribunal could not have awarded relief from the date earlier than 1973 if it found that such a demand was justified and warranted in the facts of that case. Actually the Tribunal granted the benefit ,Kith effect from 1.1.1968 only and not with effect from 15.11.1965 as demanded by the workmen.

3. The High Court's order setting aside the earlier reference does not say that the fresh dispute that may be raised should claim the benefit only from the date of raising, the fresh dispute. The order indeed says that the fresh dispute to be raised was to be "in respect of the same demand-" Now the words "same demands" mean the very same being raised by the workmen from November 1965 onwards.
 Tile said order of the High Court cannot be read as imposing or implying any restriction upon the workmen to limit the benefit claimed by them only from the date of raising of the fresh demand. It was perfectly open to them to raise a demand, subsequent to the said order, claiming the benefit with effect from a date anterior to the date of raising the demand.
