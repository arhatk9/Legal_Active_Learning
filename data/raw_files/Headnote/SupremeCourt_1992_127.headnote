 The respondents were appointed in the State Government Service purely on temporary basis, co-terminus with the tenure of the Chief Minister and Ministers, with no right of absorption. They also furnished undertaking to this effect.
 With the change in Government, the respondents were issued orders of termination. They filed Writ Petitions before the High Court challenging the termination orders and claiming that they were entitled to be absorbed in service. The High Court granted stay and directed that status quo be maintained and the respondents continued in service. The High Court was of the opinion that they were entitled to the protection of Rule 33(1)(b) of the Bombay Civil Service Rules and since termination was ordered without complying with the requirements of the said rule the termination order were null and void. It however ruled out the question of absorption. However, taking an overall view of the matter, the High Court directed that in lieu of reinstatement, they may be paid salary from the date of termination till the date of judgment and for a further period of two months-that is in all for a period of two years. Aggrieved against the said judgment, the State Government has preferred the present appeals by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 846 
 HELD : 1. The appointment of the respondents was a pure and simple contractual appointment and that such appointment is outside the purview of the Bombay Civil Service Rules, 1959. Since the tenure of the ministers at whose instance and on whose recommendation they were appointed has come to an end, their service also came to an end simultaneously.
 No order of termination as such was necessary for putting an end to their service, much less a prior notice. They ought to go out in the manner they have come in. [853-C, D] 
 2. It is evident from a reading of the order of appointment that it was purely a contractual appointment co- terminus with the tenure of the Ministers at whose choice and instance they were appointed. The order expressly stated that they shall not get any right to appointment in regular cadre. Their services were, it was expressly stated, liable to be terminated at any time without giving any notice and/or without assigning any reason. Indeed, they were asked to furnish undertakings in the above terms which they did. The order no doubt employs the words `appointed as direct recruits on purely temporary basis'. However, the order must be read as a whole and so read, it is clear that the appointment of the respondent was made otherwise than in accordance with the rules, at the choice and on the recommendation of the concerned Minister who wanted them to serve in his establishment. That the State has the power to make such contractual appointment is recognised by clause (2) of Article 310. [849 H, 850 A-C] 
 3. Rules 9(56) and 33 of the Bombay Civil Service Rules have no application to the instant case as the respondents cannot be deemed to be temporary Government servants within th meaning of the said rules inasmuch as the terms of their appointment clearly amount to an otherwise provision within the meaning of the Non-obstante clause ("except where it is otherwise expressed or implied") with which rule 2 begins.
 It is evident that the terms of their appointment and the undertaking are clearly inconsistent with the said rules and in particular with rule 33. Rule33(1)(b) and the term making their tenure co-terminus with their minister cannot go together. [853 B-F]
