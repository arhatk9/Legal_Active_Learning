On the question whether the dividends earned and the interests realised were income "from assets transfer-red directly or indirectly" by the assessee to his wife within the meaning of s. 16(3) (a) (iii) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, 
HELD : Section 16(3) (a) (iii) includes not merely the income that :arises directly from the assets transferred but also the income that arises indirectly 'from. those assets.
 In the present case the income has a nexus with the assets transferred and they are income indirectly received in respect of the transfer of cash directly made. Therefore the department is entitled to include the dividends and interest in question in computing the taxable income of the assessee. [885 C-D] C.I.T. West Bengal III v.
