 Respondent No. 5, who was the Managing Director of a limited company, resigned his post and in his capacity as a shareholder filed an application in the District Court for compulsory winding up of the company, which was ordered.
 The Official Liquidator made an application before the District Judge that as the four Directors, respondent 1 to 4, had illegally, withheld or retained certain amounts, they became liable to refund them. Contesting this application respondents 1 to 4 requested that they might be allowed to cross examine respondent no. 5, which application was rejected. On appeal the High Court set aside the order of the District Judge and remanded the case to the City Civil Court, Bombay to record additional evidence under Order 41 Rule 27, Code of Civil Procedure.
 On appeal it was contended in this Court that the High Court was wrong in directing additional evidence to be allowed under this Order.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : The High Court rightly ordered that additional evidence be recorded in this case. There was no justification whatsoever for the District Court to reject the evidence which the respondent had intended to lead or to disallow the production of documents. [895 H; 896 A] Under O. 41 r. 27 it is only where the Court had improperly refused to admit evidence or where the appellate court required additional evidence to be recorded in order to enable it to pronounce judgment that it could make such an order. Under cl. (b) of this rule the Court may require additional evidence either to enable it to pronounce judgment or when it may require additional evidence to be recorded for any other substantial cause, [894 A-B] Arjan Singh v.
