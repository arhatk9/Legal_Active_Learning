 Rule 12 (1) of Schedule I to the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, is designed to prevent the dissipation of excess profits by inflating expenditure which has no relation to the requirements of the business. The test is whether the expenditure is unreasonable and unnecessary having regard to the requirements of the business, and, in the case of directors' fees or other payments for services, to the actual services rendered. All relevant facts, especially commercial expediency or commercial practice, must be taken into consideration by the Excess Profits Tax Officer in considering whether the expenditure is reasonable and necessary; that is, he could not apply the rule to increases that can be justified on ordinary commercial principles, because, an increase in profits may in certain cases be due to increase in the activity of the management or increase in the establishment justifying a corresponding increase in the expenditure. But when huge profits are earned,, not due to any activity of managers but due to national emergencies such as war situations, the government is entitled to a certain share of the excess profits computed under the Act.
 Any commission paid on the excess profits for which the managers or employees made no sort of contribution would ex facie be unreasonable and unnecessary and the Excess Profits Tax Officer would be justified in disallowing the proportion, which, according to him, was 'unreasonable and unnecessary having regard to the requirements of the business. [530A-D; 531G-H; 532A] In the present case, the assessee is a public limited company having several branches and subsidiary companies It has a Board of Directors which looks after its business.
 The managers who look after the branches ,of the company are also members of the Board. The assessee was remunerating its directors by way of commission based on a certain fixed percentage of its net audited profits. The phrase 'net audited profits" was clarified to mean the amount after depreciation had been allowed for, but prior to any allocation or appropriation of profits including provision for taxation. The Excess Profits Tax Act came into force on April 5, 1940, and on 27th July, 1940, the phrase "including provision for tax' in the clarification, was further clarified that it was intended to cover all forms of taxation including excess profits tax and other like impositions. Therefore, no, deduction of excess profits tax was to be made prior to the calculation of managerial commissions. For the chargeable accounting years 1945 and 1946 the Excess Profits Tax Officer found that the assessee had made large profits and held that if the commission was to be paid on the ,net audited profits the whole excess profits would be taken into account for the payment of commission; that a portion of the commission attributable to excess profits, in the peculiar circumstances of war conditions. was not reasonable and necessary with. the meaning of r. 12 (1), and that any payment, in excess of the agreed proportion of the net profit's after deduction of excess profits tax, was not justified. He, therefore, disallowed a percentage of the said excess profits which would be payable to the State on account of excess profits tax liability. [526A-H;, 527A.C] 525 On the question whether the disallowed we for each of the years was rightly made, the Tribunal and the High Court held against the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The Excess Profits Tax Officer and the Tribunal have given valid reasons for not allowing the entire commission claimed on the basis of the audited accounts without deducting the excess profits tax., [531G] Ahmedabad Manufacturing & Calico Printing Co. v.
