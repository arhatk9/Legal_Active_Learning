 The Municipal Board of Pilibhit passed a resolution under the Municipalities Act, imposing a theatre tax of Rs. 25/- per show. The resolution was duty published on 16-5-1972 and objections were invited, but since no objections were received within the time prescribed u/s. 132(1) of the Act, preliminary proposals were framed and submitted to the prescribed authority, the Commissioner of Rohilkhand Division. The proposals were returned to the Board for reconsideration on the ground that the proposed rate of the theatre tax appeared to be too high, and on 28-8-1972 the Board reduced the rate to Rs. 15/- per show, though the publication of the resolution reducing the rates was dispensed with under the proviso to s. 132(2). On 16-9- 1972, the petitioner and some other owners of cinema houses, sent their objections to the initial resolution, but as these objections had not been presented for consideration when the two resolutions were passed, the Board refrained from submitting them with the modified proposals to the prescribed authority u/s. 132(4) of the Act. The modified proposals were sanctioned on 31-10-1972 and were duly converted into rules, published in the Gazette dated 14-4- 1973. The appellant move(] the High Court, but failed.
 Dismissing the appeal the Court, 
HELD : (i) There is a distinction between the period given for objections u/s. 132(1) of the U.P. Municipalities Act, and the period of limitation prescribed for proceedings before a court or a quasi-judicial authority which on the expiry of the period, confers some rights upon parties not proceeded against, so that the expiry of the prescribed time bars claims against them. the procedure under s. 132(1) is legislative and not quasi-judicial and if the objector does not file his objections within a fortnight, he may lose his right to object, but his objections will not be invalidated.
 it is not like s. 28 of the Limitation Act operating to extinguish any legal right. [256E, G, H, 257A] Niranjan Lal Bhargava v. State of U.P. 1969 A.L.J. 295, referred to (2)Section 132(4) covers any objections whatsoever, whether made within a fortnight or beyond a fortnight, provided they are sent in before the matter is submitted to the prescribed authority. In fact, there is no statutory bar against the prescribed authority itself considering the objections which may be filed before it if the interests of justice so require. [259B-C] (3)The effect of the proviso to s. 132(2) added in 1964, is that by dispensing with even the publication of the modified proposals, no such right of the appellant is violated as could be considered a condition precedent to the validity of the proceedings. Nevertheless, if patent injustice has resulted from an irregularity, in the imposition of a tax, s. 135(3) may not cure the irregularity. [259G-H, 260A] Buland Sugar v. Municipal Board [1964] INSC 245; [1965] 1 SCR 970, distinguished.
