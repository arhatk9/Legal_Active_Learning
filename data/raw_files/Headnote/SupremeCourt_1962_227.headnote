 B, a clerk in the appellant company, was found shouting and behaving in a rude and insolent manner with his superior officer. In consequence of this incident a charge-sheet was issued to him and he was asked to give his explanation for his behaviour; he was also asked to give explanation in respect of certain purchases made by him for the company.
 Eventually an enquiry was held by the Managing Director at which he found that two charges were made out, and on the basis of the findings the company dismissed B from his post.
 In the letter by the Managing Director dated October 29, 1953, addressed to B it was stated : "After giving your matter our very careful consideration, we have, therefore, painfully come to the decision that in the interest of discipline and business you should be forthwith dismissed from our service. In taking this action against you we have also taken into consideration your past record which is very much against you." The Industrial Tribunal considered that the findings were based not merely on the charges set out in the charge-sheet but on certain other charges which B was not given on opportunity to explain, and, therefore, the enquiry was vitiated and the dismissal could not be sustained. The Tribunal proceeded to consider the evidence and held that the allegation of insubordination against B was not proved. It, accordingly, ordered his reinstatement.
 Held, that the order of the Tribunal was contrary to law;
 that the Managing Director must be considered, in his letter' to have arrived at the conclusion that B's services should be terminated in the interest of discipline. though he had added one sentence to give additional weight to the decision already arrived at; and that the Tribunal was not competent to go behind the finding of, the Managing Director and consider for itself the evidence adduced before him, 576 On account of a sudden strike launched by the workmen on November 13, 1958, the company declared a lock-out. The lock-out continued till January 5, 1959, on which date the company's works were reopened, It was found that while the strike was unjustifiable and the lock-out when it was ordered on November 13, 1958, was justified, its continuance for 53 days was wholly unreasonable and, therefore, unjustified.
 Held, that where a strike is unjustified and is followed by a lock-out which has, because of its long duration, become unjustified, the proper course for an industrial tribunal is to apportion the blame and direct the payment of the wages for the period of the lock-out which could be considered as unjustified.
 Where a strike is unjustified and the lock-out is justified the workmen would not be entitled to any wages at all, but where the strike is justified and the lock-out is unjustified the workmen would be entitled to the entire wages for the period of strike and lock-out.
