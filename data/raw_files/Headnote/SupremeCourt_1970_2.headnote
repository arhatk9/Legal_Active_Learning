 The appellant was the sole selling agent of motor spare parts for the manufacturers in the State of Bombay. The respondent-Corporation was, constituted under the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act, 1949. Under s. 74 of Act and the Rules relating to contracts made under the Act, a contract relating to the purchase of goods exceeding Rupees five hundred is to be made in the name of the Corporation by the Transport Manager, and, the contract has to be in writing and in sealed in the presence of two members of the Transport Committee who should sign in token of the seal being affixed in their presence. Under s.
 74(2), a contract not made in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules is not binding on the Corporation.
 The Transport Manager of the respondent-Corporation called upon the appellant to supply certain spare parts worth more than Rupees two lakhs. A formal contract incorporating the agreed terms was not and could not be executed and sealed as required by the Act, because, at the time when the contract was entered into election of councillors to the Corporation had not been held and no Transport Committee was constituted and the powers of the Corporation and the Transport Committee were being exercised by the Commissioner pursuant to the transitory provisions of the Act. The appellant supplied goods from time to time and the Corporation made payments according to the invoices. One of the invoices was for about Rs. 49,000-00. The invoice price consisted of an additional 12-1/2% on the listed price by reason of the increase in the price made by the manufacturers. With respect to that invoice, the Transport Manager was satisfied that the rates quoted were 'proper rates' and he accepted the goods delivered on behalf of the respondent, and appropriated them. But the respondent failed to pay the amount and terminated the contract.
 The appellant filed a suit for a decree for the invoice amount and for damages. The respondent contended that the contract was not enforceable, because, it was not executed in the manner prescribed by the Act.
 On the question of the amount to which the; appellant was entitled, 
HELD : (1) The contract was not made in accordance with the provisions of the Act, for, it was not sealed, and therefore, under s. 74(2) of the Act, the contract was not binding upon the Corporation, There is nothing in the transitory provisions which excludes the operation, of s.
 74(2). Hence. even if it was not possible to comply with the rules until the elections were held there was no warrant for holding that the- 416 sub-section did not apply and that the Commissioner or the Transport ,Manager could enter into contracts without the sea of the Corporation. The appellant was accordingly not entitled to maintain a suit for the price of the goods relying upon any contractual obligation, nor maintain the claim for damages on the footing that the respondent committed a breach -of contract. [420 E, 421 B-D] (2) But the appellant was entitled to maintain his claim for compensation under s. 70 of the Contract Act. Under the section compensation would normally be the market price of the goods.
 In the circumstances of the; present case, the invoice value was the _prevailing market value of the goods and the 'appellant was entitled to it. The appellant was also entitled to interest at 6% till date of payment. [422 E, F] Secretary of State v. G. T. Sarin and Co. 1. L. R. 11 Lah..
