 In exercise of its power conferred under section 3(2) of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, the Central Government issued notifications dated 28.11.1970 and 26.7.1971 fixing the tariff value on the basis of which excise duty was to be levied on sulphuric acid and liquid chlorine respectively.
 The Respondent-assessee challenged the fixation of the tariff values for the abovesaid two items, by filling Writ petitions before the High Court. The main contentions of the assessee were that excise duty being a duty on manufacture or production, its levy could be based on the cost of production or manufacture or production, its levy could be based on the cost of production or manufacture together with any margin of profit the manufacturer may be able to make when he sells the goods in a whole-sale market at or near the factory gate; that the tariff value fixed under section 3(2) of the Act could also be only on the basis mentioned above and could not be based on the sale price of the goods much less on a weighted average sale price;
 283 and that section 3(2) gave a wide and unfettered discretion to the Central Government to fix the value at any figure it chose and so section 3(2) of the Act was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, as no guidelines have been indicated in the statute.
 The High Court allowed the Writ Petitions and gave certain directions to the Central Government. Being aggrieved against the said judgment of the High Court, the Revenue has preferred the present appeals.
 Allowing the appeals, this Court, Held: 1. The tariff values of sulphuric acid and chlorine were validly fixed under the respective notifications issued by the Central Government. Section 3(2) of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 and the notifications dated 28.11.1970 and 26.7.1971 are valid and constitutional. [299 D, E] 2.1. The High Court's reasoning restricts the freedom of rate fixation under section 3(1) to the mode of determination of value set out in section 4 and to the manufacturing cost and profit of an individual manufacturer-assessee before the authorities. It overlooks that, reading ss.3(1), 3(2) and 4 together, in the light of Bombay Tyres, it is clear that the rate of excise duty need not necessarily be ad valorem; that, even when it is ad valorem, the mode of determination of value outlined in section 4 is only one of the modes available to the Central Government which comes into operation only where the value of any item of goods is not otherwise specified in notifications issued under section 3(2); and that even where the value is to be determined under section 4, it can have any nexus with the wholesale price and is not limited to manufacturing cost and profit. The High Court has erred in reading ss.3(1) and (2) as being subject to the parameters of section 4. It is clear that section 3(1) read with the schedule is very wide and unrestricted in its language and permits the levy of duty on any basis that has nexus with manufacture or production. Section 3(1) comes into operation only in cases of goods where an ad valorem duty is set forth in the schedule but, subject only to this restriction, this sub-section too does not carry any limitation as to the manner in which the value is to be fixed, much less any limitation that the value should be determined in the same manner as under section 4. [294 C-G] 2.2. Even section 4 does not restrict the levy to manufacturing cost 284 and profit. This section read with the relevant rules only sets out the procedure by which the assessing officer has to determine the value in individual cases that come up before him. Naturally, in such cases, the statute proceeds on the basis of the position in the individual case before the officer. Whether it be the manufacturing cost plus profit basis or the price basis, the officer determines the value on the facts of the individual case without taking into account similar considerations in the case of other manufacturers. But it would not be correct to read this limitation into section 3(2) as well. Section 3(2) is a general provision which gives full liberty to Central Government to determine the value in cases where the first schedule prescribes an ad valorem levy. Section 4 does not control or limit the power of the Central Government to fix rates under section 3(2). Section 4 is subject to section 3(2) and is not attracted to cases where the value is notified under section 3(2) and not vice versa. The High Court was, therefore, not correct in finding fault with the Central Government for having fixed the tariff value at a figure related to an average of the prices at which the goods are sold to various manufacturers. There is nothing in the statute which precludes the Government from fixing the tariff value in this manner. [294 G, H; 295 A-C] Union of India v. Bombay Tyres International Ltd., [1984] 1 SCR 347, relied on.
 3.1. While section 3(2) confers a power on the Central Government to fix tariff values for goods at its pleasure, unrestricted to the terms of section 4, this cannot be done at the whim and caprice of the Government. This discretion has to be exercised by the Government in accordance with the crucial guideline that is inbuilt into the statute and also illustrated by the manner in which the determination is provided for in section 4. The statute leaves one in no doubt that the rate of duty is to be fixed ad valorem i.e.
 on the basis of the value of the goods. It cannot be disputed that the normal indication of the value of the goods will be its price and, that the statute intends price to be the relevant factor is clear from the language of section 4 under which the statute itself fixes the value for the majority of cases. The value may be derived with reference to the wholesale price, the retail price or the average price at which the goods are sold by the manufacturer concerned or even by the price at which the goods are sold by the manufacturer concerned or even by the price at which the goods are sold by any particular person or place or the average price which the goods command in the whole country or any part thereof. It can be fixed at the 285 lowest of such prices, at the highest of such prices or at some average (mean, media, mode etc.) of such prices as the Government may consider appropriate in the case of any particular commodity. [295 E-H; 296 A,B] 3.2. That the weighted average so fixed exceeds the manufacturing cost and profit of a particular manufacturer, can be no reason for doubting its validity. Equally, there is no acceptable logic in the High Court's suggestion that it should be fixed at the lowest of the prices at which the manufacturer is able to sell his goods in the wholesale market. To apply such a measure will restrict the fixation of the value at figures even less than those that can be arrived at under section 4. The whole purpose of section 3(2) is to enable the Revenue to free itself from the shackles of section 4, inter alia, in cases where the Government feels that the application of that section would lead to difficulties and harassments. It cannot be said that the tariff value has been manipulated to enhance the rate of duty. The Central Government has the undoubted power to enhance the rates and the validity of a notification having such an effect is not open to challenge even if it is done under the "guise" of fixing a tariff value. But there is no such guise or facade in this case and the tariff value has been fixed on the basis of relevant criteria having a nexus to the value of the goods. [298 D-G] Veeran v.

 4. The generality of section 3(2) is unrestricted and section 3(3) only explains a few possible ways in which that power can be, and could always 286 have been, exercised. Likewise, the scheme of ss.3 and 4 leave no doubt that section 4 is without prejudice to the provisions of section 3 and the newly inserted section 4(3) only makes this abundantly clear. [299 A]
