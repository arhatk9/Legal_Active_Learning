 Prior to 1961, the petitioner used to carry on extensive trade in the sale of Kendu leaves. In 1962, the State of Orissa acquired a monopoly in the trade of Kendu leaves and put restrictions on the fundamental rights of the petitioner. Three notifications were issued by the State on January 8, 1962, January 25, 1962 and March 10, 1962 for that purpose. In his petition under Art. 32, the petitioner challenged the validity of the notifications and also the validity of the whole Act, particularly ss. 3 and 4, on the ground that they violated Art. 19 (1) (f) and (g). The petitioner prayed for a declaration that the whole act was ultra vires and also an order restraining the State from giving effect to the notification and the Act, Held, that the Orissa Kendu Leaves (Control of Trade) Act, 1961, is a valid piece of legislation. The creation of State monopoly in Kendu Leaves is within the scope of Art.
 19 (6) of the Constitution as amended by the constitution (First amendment) Act, 195 1. ,A law creating a State monopoly in the narrow and limited sense is valid under the latter part of Art. 19 (6). If it indirectly impinges on any other right, its validity cannot be challenged on that ground. If the said law contains other incidental provisions which are not essential and do not constitute an integral part of the monopoly created by it, the validity of those provisions has to be tested under the first part of Art. 19 (6). If they directly impinge on any other fundamental right granted by Art. 19 (1), the validity of the said clauses has to be tested by reference to the corresponding clauses of Art. 19.
 692 The essential attributes of the law creating a monopoly will vary with the nature of the trade or business in which the monopoly is created. They will depend upon the nature of the commodity, the nature of commerce in which it is involved and several other circumstances.
 A law relating to State monopoly in respect of road transport or air transport would not normally infringe the citizen's fundamental right under Art. 19 '(1) (f).
 Likewise, a State monopoly to manufacture steel, armaments, transport vehicles or railway engines and coaches can be provided for by law and that would not normally impinge on Art. 19 (1) (f). However, if the law creating such monopolies makes incidental provisions directly impinging on the citizens' right under Art. 19 (1) (f), the case would be different.
 Having regard to the scheme of the State monopoly envisaged by the Act, s. 4 cannot be said to be such an essential part of the said monopoly as to fall within the expression "law relating to" under Art. 19 (6). The validity of s. 4 has to be tested in the light of the first part of Art. 19 (6) so far as the petitioner's rights under Art. 19 (1) (g) are concerned and under Art. 19 (5) so far as his rights under Art. 19 (1) (f) are concerned, So tested, the restrictions regarding the fixation of prices prescribed by s. 4 are reasonable and in the interest of the general public both under Art. 19 (5) and Art. 19 (6). Hence s. 4 is valid.
 Section 3 of the Act is also not open to any challenge.
 This section allows either the Government or an officer of the Government authorised in that behalf or an agent in respect of the unit in which the leaves have grown, to purchase or transport Kendu leaves. The Court was satisfied that the two categories of persons specified in cls. (b) and (c) are intended to work as agents of the Government and all their actions and dealings in pursuance of the provisions of the Act would be actions and dealings on behalf of the Government and for the benefit of the Government. If s. 3 is valid, s. 8 which authorises the appointment of agents, must also be held valid.
 When the State carries on any trade, business or industry it must inevitably carry it on either departmentally or through its officers appointed for that purpose. In the very nature of things, the State cannot function without the help of its servants or employees and that inevitably introduces the concept of agency in a narrow and limited sense. There are some trades or businesses in which it may be inexpedient to undertake the work of trade or business departmentally or with the assistance 693 of State servants. in such cases, it is open to the State to employ the services of agents, provided the agents work on behalf of the State and not for themselves.
 Rule 7 (5) provides that on appointment as agent the person appointed shall execute an agreement in such form as Government may direct. This rule is bad because it leaves it to the sweet will and pleasure of the officer concerned to fix any terms and conditions on an ad hoc basis. This is beyond the competence of the State Government. The terms and conditions of the agreement must be prescribed by rules.
 When the agreement actually made in this case is considered, it leaves no room for doubt that the person appointed under the agreement to work the monopoly of the State is not an agent in the strict and narrow sense of the term con.
 templated by Art. 19 (6) (ii). The agent appointed under this agreement seems to carry on the trade substantially on his own account. If he makes any profit after paying the amount specified in the contract, that profit is his. If he incurs any loss, that loss is his. He is not made accountable to tile State Government and the State Government is not responsible for his actions. It is impossible to hold that the agreement is consistent with the terms of s. 3 of the Act. Hence, the agreement is invalid.
 The State Government cannot implement the provisions of the Act with the assistance of agents appointed under the said invalid agreement.
