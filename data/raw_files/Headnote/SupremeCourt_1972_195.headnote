 Under clause (6) of the agreement between the assessee company and its Selling Agent, discount was to be allowed to the Selling Agents not only on sales effected through the said Agents or sub-agents but also on sales effected directly by the principal. Under clause (8) the Agents were responsible for the payment if the price due from the purchasers immediately after-the goods left the Principal's works or godown. Such payment bad to be made on presentation of necessary papers or documents by the assessee, not later than a fortnight after the goods were despatched. In default of payment the assessee was entitled to charge interest until realisation at the rate of six per cent per annum on the balance for the time being outstanding. Under cl. (9) of the agreement, the Agents were also responsible for due fulfilment of all contracts made by them whether for ready or forward sales and also for the consequences of any breach of contract by any customer and for all losses and damages arising therefrom to the assessee provided there was no default on the part of the assessee in manufacturing or giving delivery of any goods required or sold under any contract in compliance with the terms of the agreement.
 The commission paid by the assessee to the Selling Agents was allowed by the income tax authorities as deductible expenditure for some years. In respect of the assessment year 1955-56 however the assessees claim for such deduction was disallowed. The Income Tax Officer held that the payment had not been made on business considerations. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner further held that the agreement had not been acted upon. The Tribunal however did not agree with the view that the payment had been, made for extra-commercial considerations, or that the agreement had not been acted upon. The High Court in reference held that the expenditure in question was not expended for the purpose of the asses was business within the meaning of s. 10(2)(xv) of the income-tax Act, 1922 inasmuch as in the accounting year all sales were directly effected by the assessee and no sale was effected by the Selling Agents. In appeal to this Court by certificate, 
HELD : (i) The jurisdiction of the High Court under s. 66 is only an advisory jurisdiction. That being so it can only Pronounce its opinion on the questions referred to it. It cannot sit as an appellate court over the decision of the Tribunal., [1099C] In the present case the High Court overlooked the effect of cls. 6, 8 and 9 of the agreement. it also overlooked the significance of the fact that in the earlier years the commission paid to the Selling Agents had been considered is I deductible expenditure. It also did not take notice 1098 of the contention of the assessee that though the sales were directly effected by the assessee they were all convassed by the Selling Agents.
 [1102E-F] The Tribunal after taking into consideration the various terms of the agreement as well as the significance of the deduction given in the earlier assessment years came to the conclusion that the Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner erred in, their opinion that the expenditure was not incurred for any commercial expediency or that the agreement was not in force in; the relevant accounting year. The Tribunal had given good reasons in support of its conclussion. The primary facts found by, the Tribunal and the factual inference drawn thereform was, not open to review by the High Court. [1103F] The appeal must accordingly be allowed.
