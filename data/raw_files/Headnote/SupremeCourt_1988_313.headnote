 Certain premises in Rae Bareli were given on rent to an Aushadhalaya in the year 1946 or 1947 by the landlord. The Aushadhalaya went out of existence but an employee of the same, respondent No. I continued occupying the said premises. He also paid rent in the name of the tenant and not in his own name.
 Appellant No. I moved an application under section 12 of the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act for declaring that the premises had fallen vacant and for allotment of the said premises in his favour.
 Section 12 of the Act provides that where a landlord does not occupy the building or substantially removes his effect therefrom and allows to occupy any person who is not a member of his family then the vacancy should be deemed. The Rent Controller found that the premises was not occupied by the tenant but by a person other than the tenant. The Rent Controller held that the shop was vacant and allowed the application. In an appeal the High Court dismissed the application. The High Court considered respondent No. 1 to be a part of the Aushadhalaya and the rent that was being paid and credited all along in the name of the Aushadhalaya to be treated as the rent on behalf of the respondent No. 1.
 Hence this appeal by special leave. Affirming the decision of the Rent Controller and setting aside the decision of the High Court, this Court, 
 HELD: In this case, admittedly, the property is not being occupied by the members of the tenant's family. It is not vacant but it is occupied by Respondent No. l, who was not the tenant at any relevant time. In our opinion, the deemed vacancy of the premises though not actually vacant, has happened. [431E] PG NO 426 PG NO 427 The tenant of the premises in question has long left.
 An employee without the consent though, perhaps with knowledge of the landlord was occupying the premises but in such circumstances it cannot be held as the High Court has done that there was no deemed vacancy. The High Court was in error in holding that the Aushadhalaya was a tenant through the petitioners. The tenant was the Aushadhalaya and the proprietors thereof. It is an admitted factual position and the High Court recognised that the Aushadhalaya was closed in the year 1976. The High Court commented that the landlord recognised Respondent No. 1 as a tenant and was charging rent from him. That is wrong and incorrect. There was no such evidence. No rent was charged from Respondent No. 1. He never paid any rent. The rent was paid in the name of the Aushadhalaya by Respondent No. l. [431F-H; 432A] The Landlord knew that there was a change in the occupation but the landlord did not consent as there was no evidence and Respondent No.1 has not said that there was any change of tenancy. The tenancy was not in the name of Respondent No. 1. The premises, indubitably, was in the name of the Aushadhalaya. It was not in occupation or possession of the Aushadhalaya, its proprietors or partners, and at the relevant time Respondent No.1 did not claim or purported to occupy the same on behalf of the Aushadhalaya. He claimed and asserted his own right of occupation. He was not the tenant. The premises, indubitably, was occupied by the person other than the tenant without his consent but perhaps with the knowledge of the landlord. [432B-D]
