 The Respondents substantive members of the Maharashtra Civil Service- challenged before the Central Administrative Tribunal the selection of the appellants to IAS by way of selection under the IAS (Recruitment) Rules, 1954. They claimed that their names were placed on the select list for promotion to IAS, but they could not be appointed because the vacancies occurring in the State were being filled by resorting to special selection and appointing persons like the appellants from the non-State Civil Service. They also sought quashing of the appointment of five other persons who had already been appointed to IAS by way of special selection. The Tribunal quashed the selection of the appellants to LAS, and dismissed the application in respect of the other persons. Aggrieved by the said judgment of the Tribunal quashing their selections, the appellants preferred the present appeals.
 These appeals called for interpretation of the expression 'in special cases from among persons' in Rule 4(1) (c) and the expression 'in special circumstances' in Rule 8(2) of the. LAS (Recruitment) Rules, 1954.
 Allowing the appeals, this Court, 
HELD- 11.The expression "In special cases from among persons in 568 S.4(1)(c) of the LAS (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 means the selection as special cases of the persons who have established their outstanding merit and ability while serving the State. Members of the State Civil Service who are not 'outstanding' but are only 'good' and 'very good' are also eligible to be considered for appointment to [AS but under Rule 8(2) of the Rules, it is only an 'outstanding' officer who is eligible. It is the outstanding merit and ability which makes him a 'special case' in terms of Rule 8(2) of the Rules. Rule 8(2) of the Rules read with Regulation 3 of the Regulations lays down the procedure for making the special selection provided under Rule 4(1)(c) of the Rules. The Central Government, being the appointing authority to the IAS, has to be finally satisfied about the existence of the " special circumstances' as a condition precedent for making special recruitment. The "special circumstances' are to be spelled- out from Rule 8(2) of the Rules read with Regulation 3 of the Regulations. Rule 8(2) which talks of "outstanding ability and merit" when read with Regulation 3(1) and 3(4A) of the Regulations makes it clear that the 'special cir- cumstances' required to be seen are (i) the existence of officers with 12 years of continuous service in a gazetted post under the State Government other than State Civil Service Officers who are of outstanding merit and ability and (ii) the satisfaction of the State Government that, in public interest, it is necessary to consider such officers for promotion to the IAS. [573 D-G] 1.2. Reading Rule 8(2) and the Regulations together it is clear that the process of selection has to be initiated by the State Government and as such it is for the State Government in the first instance to be satisfied regarding the existence of the 'special circumstances". The Central Government being the appointing authority has to finally approve the State Government's proposals which reach the Central Government through the process of selection. [573 H;
 574 A, E] 1.3. In the Instance case, there were "special circumstances" before the State Government to make recruitment under the Regulations. In the face of clear pleadings on the record the Tribunal was not justified in holding that there was no material on the record to show the existence of " special circumstances". The Tribunal was wholly unjustified in asking the Central Government to show the existence of "special circumstances" in terms of Rule 8(2) of the Rules. The scheme of the Rules and the Regula- tions clearly show that it is the State Government which has to he satisfied 569 regarding the existence of "special circumstances'. The Central Government comes into the picture at the last stage when it makes the appointment under Regulation 3(4) and 3(4A) of the Regulations. [575 H, 576 A-B] 1.4. It cannot be said that in terms of Rule 9(1) read with Rule 9(3)(a)(ii) of the Rules, no vacancies were made available for special recruits. In fact the stand of the State Government before the Tribunal clearly shows that vacancies were available for appointment of the special recruits. [576 C-D]
