 The respondents-landlords in the two appeals obtained decrees of eviction against the legal representatives of the original tenants of the premises in dispute . In execution, the appellants objected, contending that since they were not impleaded as parties in the eviction proceedings, their right to tenancy, which was an independent one, could not be put to an end by permitting the decrees to be executed, and that the decrees obtained against other members of the family would not bind them.
 While the courts below rejected the objection in one case, in the other case the executing court held that in view of the controversy on questions of fact involved, the appellants objection could be finally decided only after the parties were allowed to lead evidence, and hence fixed a date for trial of the dispute. However, on appeal by the landlord, the High Court held that the appelant was bound by the decree and her objection was filed with the sole object of delaying the execution. Hence, the appellant filed the appeal,by special leave,contending that since she was left out of the proceeding,the decree was not only not binding on her, but it could not be kept alive even against the others.
 On behalf of the decree-holders it was contended that when the tenancy rights devolved the heirs of a tenant on his death, the incidence of tenancy remained the same as earlier enjoyed by the original tenant and it has a single tenancy which devolved on them. There was no division of the premises or of the rent payable, and the position as between the landlord and tenant continued unaltered, andthe heirs succeeded to the tenancy as joint tenants.
 518 Allowing civil Appeal No.2056 of 1991 and dismissing Civil Appeal No. 2057 of 1991, this Court, 
 HELD: 1.1 The principle of representation of the interest of a person, not impleaded by name in a judicial proceeding, through a named party is not unknown. A Karta of Joint Hindu Family has always been recognised as a representative of the other members of the Joint Hindu Family, and so has beenatrustee. In cases where the provisions of order 1,Rule 8 of the Civil procedure Code 1908 are attracted, a named party in a suit represents the other persons interested in the litigation, and likewise a receiver appointed in one case represents the interests of the litigating parties in another case against a stranger.
 Similarly, the real owner is entitled to the benefits under a decree obtained by his benamidar against a stranger and at the same time, is also bound by the decision. Examples can be multiplied. [522B-C] 
 1.2 Under Explanation VI to Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 where persons litigate bonafide in respect of a public right or of a private right claimed in common for themselves and others, all persons interested in such right shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so litigating, subject of course,to the essential condition that the interest of a person concerned has really been represented by the others in other words, his interest has been looked after in a bona fide manner. If there be any clash of interests between the person concerned and his assumed representative, or if the latter, due to collusion or for any other reason, mala fide neglects to defend the case, he cannot be considered to be a representatve.The issue, when it becomes relevant has, therefore, to be answered with reference to the facts and circumstances of the individual case. [522D-F] 
 1.3 So far as Section 19 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, is concerned, when it directs that the heirs of a Hindu dying intestate shall take his property as tenants-in- common, it is dealing with the rights of the heirs inter se amongst them, and not with their relationship with a stranger having a superior or distinctly separate right therein. The relationship between the staranger and the heirs of a deceased tenant is not the subject matter of the section. Similar is the situation when the tenant is Mohammedan. [524E-F] 
 1.4 In the instant case, in the first appeal, since disputed questions of fact are involved, including the parentage of the appellant and her allegations of collision between the landlord and the other legal heirs, the High Court, should not have closed the mater finally without 519 waiting for the evidence, as directed by the executing Court. The judgement of the High Court is, therefore, set aside and the matter remitted to the executing court for a fresh decision after permitting the parties to lead evidence. [522H,523A-B] 
 1.5 In the other appeal, although adequate liberty was given by the Additional Rent Controller and the Tribunal to lead evidence in support of their cases , appellant never availed of the same and went on delaying the proceedings by repeated prayers of adjournment. There were also other circumstances adverse to the case of the appellants, including the facts that the rent was paid to the landlord by their mother and brothers and never by them , and they are young girls in the family who are being looked after by the elders. In the circumstances, they must be held to be effectively represented by the named judgement debtors.[523C-D] Textile Association (India) Bombay Unit v.Balmohan Gopal Kurup and Another, [1990] 4SCC 700 and Kanji Manji v.
