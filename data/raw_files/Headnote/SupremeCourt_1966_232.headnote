 During the assessment proceedings of a company, the Income- tax Officer discovered that there. was a large accretion to the wealth of the assessee, which had not been disclosed in the assessment proceedings of the assessee, and the, Officer issued notices under s. 34 for the reassessment of income during that period. The assessee filed writ petitions in the High Court, in reply to which the Income-tax Officer filed affidavits stating that relying on the information received by him, he had reason to believe that the assessee had not disclosed fully and truly all material facts and in consequence, income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment. The writ petitions were rejected and the order was confirmed in appeal by the High Court. In appeals by the assessee, this Court, HELD : The appeals must be dismissed.
 From the, affidavit of the Income-tax Officer it clearly appeared that there had been considerable increase in the investments in the transactions and the wealth of the assessee. The Income-tax Officer was not seeking to reassess the income on a mere change of opinion. [989 B] The Income-tax Officer had prima facie reason to believe that information material to assessment had been withheld, and that on account of withholding of that information income liable to tax had escaped assessment. From the mere production of the books of account., it could not be inferred that there had been full disclosure of the material facts necessary for the purpose of assessment. Sections 23 and 24 of the Act lay that the assessee is under a duty to disclose fully and truly material facts necessary for the assessment of the year and that duty is not discharged merely by the production of the books of accounts or other evidence. It is the duty of the assessee to bring to the notice of the Income-tax Officer particular items in the books of account or portions of documents which are relevant. Even if it be assumed that from the books produced, the Incometax Officer, if he had been circumspect, could have found out the truth, the Income-tax Officer may not on that account be precluded from exercising the power to assess income which had escaped assessment. [989 G990 B] It is not necessary or imperative that a notice under s. 34 must specify under which of the two clauses-cl. (a) or cl.
 (b) of sub-s. (1) of s. 34, the notice is issued. [986 A] P. R. Mukherjee v. Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal, 30 I.T.R. 535, approved.
 Two conditions precedent must co-exist, before a notice under s. 34 (1)(a) of the Act may be issued : the income-tax Officer must have reason to believe (1) that income, profits or gains had been under assessed, and (2) that such under assessment was due to non-disclosure of material facts by the assessee. Where the Income-tax Officer has prima 985 facie reasonable grounds for believing that there has been a non-disclosure of primary material fact, that by itself gives him jurisdiction to issue notice under s. 34 and the adequacy or otherwise of the grounds of such belief is not open to investigation by the Court.
