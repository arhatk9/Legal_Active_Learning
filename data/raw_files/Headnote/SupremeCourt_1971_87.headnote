 The State of U. P. filed an appeal in this Court against the judgment, of the High Court holding the dismissal of the first respondent from service invalid. The appeal was heard by two Judges of this Court and the junior Judge delivered judgment on behalf of the Court, allowing the appeal. The first respondent thereupon wrote, got printed and published and circulated a pamphlet containing scurrilous criticism of the senior Judge using the word dishonest judgment, open dishonesty deliberately and dishonestly and utter dishonesty. He also stated in the pamphlet that the senior Judge cleverly asked the junior Judge to deliver the judgment, and that the junior Judge toed his line by writing what the senior Judge told him to write. The President of the Bar Association of the Supreme Court and three other Advocates filed a petition supported by the affidavits of the advocates, about 4 months after the circulation of the pamphlet, for committing the firs respondent and the printer and publisher of the pamphlet for contempt of court.
 The first respondent deliberately avoided service till the senior Judge retired and then filed a counter affidavit containing an unconditional apology and fresh abuses of the senior Judge.
 
HELD: (1) Under Art. 129 of the Constitution this Court has the power to punish for contempt of itself, and under Art. 143(2) it can investigate any such contempt. [98A-B] The Constitution makes this Court the guardian of fundamental rights and hence it would not enforce any law which imposes unreasonable restrictions on the precious right of freedom of speech. [92D-E] Under the existing law of contempt of court any publication which is calculated to interfere with the due course of justice or proper administration of law by this Court would amount to contempt of court. A 77 scrurrilous attack on a Judge, in respect of a judgment or past conduct has in our country the inevitable effect of undermining the confidence of the public in the Judiciary;
 and if confidence in Judiciary goes administration of justice definitely suffers. [97C-E] Therefore, assuming Art. 19(2) applies to the existing law of contempt the restrictions on freedom of speech are reasonable and are in public interest [97B] Perspective Publications Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, [1968] INSC 280; [1969] 2 S.C.R. 779, 791, 792 and R. C. Cooper v. Union of India, [1970] INSC 129; [1970] 2 S.C.C. 298, 301, followed.

 (2) The pamphlet in the present case, read as a whole, constituted gross contempt of this Court. [98F] The first respondent admitted that he assisted in drafting an impeachment motion against the senior Judge. The pamphlet was ostensibly prepared for that purpose. He therefore used the word dishonest in the pamphlet in order to bring the allegations against the senior Judge within the word misbehaviour in Art. 124(4), and not, with the special sense or meaning that the Judge committed errors; because, even gross errors cannot amount to misbehaviour. To say that the junior Judge toed the line and surrendered his own judgment in deference to or to the dictation of another Judge is flagrant contempt. The first respondent's apology and avowed respect for the junior Judge were not genuinely intended. [99A; 101G; 104E] In re Moti Lal Ghose, [1918] I.L.R. Cal. 169, 182, Emperor v. Marmadule Pakhall, A.I.R. 1923 Bom. 8, 10 and In Re.
 Murli Monohar Prasad, [1929] I.L.R. 8 Pat. 323, 340, approved.
 (3) Article 105(2) does not apply to the facts of the case.
 There was nothing to establish the publication of the pamphlet as a publication by or under the authority of either House of Parliament, [102G; 104B] (4) The Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Act, 1956. does not protect the first respondent, because the protection of Ss. 3 and 4 of that Act is limited to newspapers or broadcasting agencies, and that too provided the publication was in public interest and without malice. But in the present case, the publication was not in a newspaper. [102D, F 103F, H] (5) In the pamphlet the judgment was criticized as containing errors and dishonesty of the senior Judge was alleged. No evidence to justify the contempt could be allowed because, if such justification is allowed, the court hearing the contempt application.,- will have to act as an appellate court, which is not its function; and it would encourage disappointed litigants to avenge their defeat by abusing the Judge. [104H; 105A] In the matter of K. L. Gauba, [1942] I.L.R. 13 Lah. 411, approved.
 (6) Notice was issued to the respondents and opportunity was given to them to file affidavits stating facts and contentions in their defence. The first respondent's request for adjournment of the ground that the advocates he wanted to engage were engaged in fighting elections was refused, because, 78 the Court considered the request unreasonable and was made with a view to delay matters. The contemnors, therefore, were given a fair and reasonable opportunity to defend themselves. [105E-F] (7) Since the essential facts stated in one advocates affidavit were admitted by the first respondent, and the pamphlet and the affidavit of another advocate were annexed to prove the facts, it was not necessary to disclose any further source of information. [106A, B-E] , (8) All affidavits were filed along with the petition and the entire evidence of the petitioners was disclosed with the initial petition. [106F] (9) There was no irrelevant material in the petition. On the facts the charge against the first respondent was quite clear and simple and it was not necessary that a formal charge should have been drawn up by the petitioners or this Court. By setting out the extracts from the pamphlet point- ed attention had been drawn to the offending passages.

 A. No. 27/1964 dt. 31-1-1966, referred to.
 (10) Whether there has been delay or not in filing a petition depends on the facts of a particular case. In the present case, after the first respondent distributed a copy of the pamphlet in the Bar Association of the Supreme Court, the petitioners had to ascertain facts regarding its publication, printing etc. Further the petitioners had to take steps only after the Attorney General did not move in the matter. [108B-G] State Government Madhya Pradesh v. Vinaya Kumar, A.I.R.
 [1952] Nag. 34, referred to.
 (11) It is not the law, even in England, that only the Attorney-General should move in contempt matters. Besides, the position of an Attorney General in England is quite different from that of the Attorney General in India.
 Unlike the Attorney General in India, he does not have to receive instructions from Government to move a contempt petition. Moreover, there is nothing in law which prevents this Court from entertaining a petition at the instance of the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association and other Advocates of this Court, since the Bar is vitally concerned in the maintenance of the dignity of courts and the proper administration of justice. Further, this Court can issue a notice suo mota. [109D-G] (12) There was no allegation or proof that any of the signatories of the motion of impeachment circulated the pamphlet outside Parliament, and hence, there was no necessity to join them as parties. Also, the fact that those members of Parliament had not been made correspondents did not exonerate the first respondent or make his publication any the less contempt of court. [102C; 109G-H] (13) The fact that the first respondent filed a writ petition containing the substance of the impeachment motion did not afford a defence when he committed contempt by circulating the pamphlet. [11OA-C] (14) Even if the senior Judge did not choose to take any action for contempt when the allegations were made during the hearing of the appeal it was open to the petitioners to initiate the proceedings. [110C-D] (15) There was no substance in the contention that the petition was filed with the object of protecting the senior Judge who was the first petitioner's junior at the Bar and friend and therefore the filing of the petition with a vengeful motive was itself contempt of court. [110D-F] 79 (16) The pamphlet constituted gross contempt of this Court.
 His apology was no apology when it was coupled with fresh abuses of the senior Judge. Therefore, he deserved a heavy sentence, but since such contempt$ of this Court were happily rare, a lenient sentence of 2 months simple imprisonment should be imposed. [111OG; 111G-H] [Me Court however warned that any such future contempt will not be dealt with so leniently.]
