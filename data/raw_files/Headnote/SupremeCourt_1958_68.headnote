 The nomination papers of three candidates for election as members of the State Assembly were rejected by the Returning 1168 Officer on the ground that the first two of them were Patels and the third, a Shanbhog, of their villages and as such they were holders of offices of profit under the Government and consequentlydisqualified from membership of the State Assembly underArt. 191 of the Constitution of India. The validity of the election was challenged by some of the electors of the constituency by an election petition under s. 100(1)(c) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, on the ground that the nomination papers of the three candidates were wrongly rejected. It was contended for the petitioners that the candidates in question were not holders of offices of profit under the Government because (1) they were holding their offices by hereditary right and not under the Government, and (2) there was no direct payment of their dues by the Government. It was not disputed that village offices are governed by the Mysore Village Offices Act, 1908, and it was found that Patels and Shanbhogs were holding their offices by reason of the appointment by the Government, though in certain cases the statute gave the heir of the last holder a right to be appointed if the statutory requirements were fulfilled, that they worked under the control and supervision of the Government and were removable by it, and that their remuneration was paid by it out of its funds and assets :
 Held, that the holder of a village office though he may have a hereditary right, does not get the office till he is appointed by the Government under whom the office is held.
 Accordingly, Patels and Shanbhogs are holders of offices of profit under the Government and their nomination papers were rightly rejected by the Returning Officer.
