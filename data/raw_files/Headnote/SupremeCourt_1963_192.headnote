 In a civil suit the appellant was examined as a witness and he tendered in evidence an agreement, which in the Munsiff's opinion was forged. The Munsiff, however, in his judgment did not record the opinion required for ordering the prosecution of the appellant under s. 479A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Respondents 2 to 5, who were the plaintiffs in the suit, had applied, before the suit was disposed of, that action be taken against the appellant un- der s. 479A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In disposing of the suit the Munsiff did not record the opinion which he was required to record if he desired that action should be taken against the appellant under s. 479A. But on the application of the Respondents, the Munsiff directed that complaint be made against the appellant in exercise of the powers vested under s. 476 Code of Criminal Procedure for the offence of fraudulently or dishonestly using as genuine a document which the appellant knew or had reason to believe to be forged. This order of the Munsiff was confirmed in appeal by the District Judge, and the revision to the High Court, too, was dismissed. In appeal by special leave,- 
HELD: (i) Section 479A of the Code of Criminal Procedure excludes the jurisdiction of the Court to proceed under s.
 476 to 479, only in respect of offences under s. 195(b) & (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure where a person appearing before the Court or a witness has intentionally given false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding or has intentionally fabricated false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of the judicial pro- ceeding.
 958 (ii)The offence punishable under s. 471 of the Indian Penal Code does not fall within the category contemplated by s.
 479A Code of Criminal Procedure, and therefore, the authority of the Court to act under s. 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not impaired.
