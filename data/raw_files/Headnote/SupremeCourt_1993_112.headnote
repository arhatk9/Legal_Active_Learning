 The appellant-landlords filed an eviction petition against respondent-tenants on the ground that they required the shop premises for their own use. The prescribed authority dismissed the petition holding that the appellants' requirement was not bonafide and that greater hardship would be caused to the respondents than to the appellants. On appeal the appellate authority held that the requirement of the appellants was genuine and bonafide. The respondent filed a Writ Petition before the High Court and it observed that the appellate authority ought to have ascertained the actual accommodation available in the property after excluding the accommodation necessary for residential purposes and should have found out whether two rooms on the first floor could be spared for business. 'Me High Court further observed that the appellate authority was not justified in entering into the question of privacy and that the appellants had failed to disclose their residential accommodation. The High Court thus quashed the order of the appellate authority and restored the appeal to the file of the appellate authority to be decided afresh after hearing the parties and in the light of the observations made by it.
 This has been challenged in the present appeal by special leave.
 On behalf of the appellants, it was contended that it was not open to the High Court to have reassessed the evidence, especially under its Writ jurisdiction.
 145 On behalf of the Respondent it was contended that the findings of the appellate authority were perverse and therefore a re-assessment of the evidence was called for.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1.1. Even in a second appeal the High Court must restrict itself to questions of law; all the more so in a writ petition. [147H] 1.2. In the instant case, the High Court re-assessed the evidence and went beyond its legitimate jurisdiction. The intervention of this Court is therefore, called for, especially since the High Court has directed the appellate authority to decide the appeal afresh "in the light of the observations made above". This Court does not approve of some of those observations. It is very difficult to see how a landlord can be asked to build alternate premises. It is also very difficult to see how a landlord who has asked for the eviction of a tenant from commercial premises can be faulted for not having given particulars of his residential accommodation and how this can be treated as a purposeful attempt on his part to keep back relevant material from the court, which should be taken into consideration in deciding his bona fide need. [148A-C] 
2. The judgment and order under appeal are set aside. The order of the appellate authority dated 26th November, 1990 is restored.
