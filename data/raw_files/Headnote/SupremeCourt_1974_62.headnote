 The respondent company was owner of a large area of land in Bombay, on a part of which there was a building under construction. The bulk of the remaining part was lying vacant. The Assessor and Collector of the Municipal Corporation determined the market value of the whole land on a notional basis and fixed the hypothetical annual rental value of the portion of land on which a building was being built as well as the vacant land.
 The respondent's appeal to the Small Cause Court was dismissed. Applying the doctrine of sterility the High Court held that although a vacant plot of land was rateable under- the provisions of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act and so was land which bad been built upon, yet, any part of land which was being actually built upon was not rateable until the building was finished because no tenant could take it in that condition.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant Corporation that the High Court erred in applying the doctrine of sterility to land rateable under the provisions of the Act ; that, the High Court overlooked the essential distinction between the Indian and English law which was that the basis for determining the rateable value in India was the value of the property to the owner and not to the occupier, and, that, every kind of 'land' as defined by s.3(r) of the Act was rateable under s. 1 54 of the Act simply because it had a value to the owner of it and not because it was yielding any income or was usefully or beneficially occupied or enjoyed by tenant or any other kind of occupant paying for the use of it. Allowing the appeal.
 
HELD : The judgment under appeal is erroneous as it was held there that land which was being rated as vacant ceased to be subject to any rating at all simply because a building began to be made on it by the owner. The rule of interpretation that, where two views are reasonably or equally open,. the court should adopt the one which benefits the assessee would enable it to do no more than to treat land which is actually being built upon on the same footing as vacant land so long as no structure capable of occupation and letting is completed on it. [702 D-E] Land which was being built upon should not be rated like land on which a building has been actually constructed unless and until the construction had reached a stage at which some occupation of the constructed portion was also legally and actually possible so that it could. be taken into account in determining the rateable value. [701 F] The doctrine of sterility in the context of the provisions to be construed could not apply in this case. In England, land which is in the process of being built upon is equated with vacant land which is not yielding any profit, so that it ceases to be "rateable" land. But, under the statute, all 'land' whether vacant or in the process of being built upon is rateable according to well settled principles. [700 A] West Bromwich School Board v.

 The principles upon which lands are rated in this country have been practically settled by the decisions of this Court which held that the mode of assessment in every case must be directed towards finding out the annual letting value of land which is based on rating of land, and, by definition, "land" includes land which is either being built upon or has been built upon. A reference to the provisions of the Act shows that, after a building has been completed, the letting value of the building which becomes part of the land will be the primary or determining factor in fixing the annual rent for which the land which has been built upon "might reasonably be expected to be let from year to year". All that s 154 seems to contemplate by mentioning "land or building" is that land which is vacant or which has not been built upon may be treated, for the purposes of valuation. on a different footing from land which has actually been built upon. The relevant provisions of the Act do not mention and seem to take no account, for purposes of rating, of any building which is only in the course of being constructed, although s. 3(r) of the Act makes it clear that land which is being built upon is also "land". Hence, so long as a building is not completed or constructed to such an extent that, at least, a partial completion notice can be given so that the completed portion can be occupied or let, the land can, for purposes of rating, be equated with or treated as vacant land. It is only when the building which is being put up is in such a state that it is actually and legally capable of occupation that the letting value of the building can enter into the computation for rating. Although the definition of land, which is rateable covers three kinds of "land", yet, for the purposes of rating s. 154 recognises only two categories. Therefore, all land must fall in one of these two categories for purposes of rating and not outside. [699 D-G] Corporation of Calcutta v. Sm.

 In the instant case the land which was being assessed as reteable so long as it was vacant land had been treated as entirely outside the scope or sphere of rateability just because a building was being erected upon it. As there is no provision in the Act which has the effect of conferring such an immunity or exemption upon land which is being built upon, it is not possible to uphold the conclusion which produces such a startling result. [700C] (The case was sent back to the Assessor and Collector with a direction that the whole land will be valued for the purpose of rating in the relevant year as vacant land.)
