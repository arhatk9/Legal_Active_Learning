 The petitioner, a limited company with its registered office in New Delhi, carries on business of financing purchase of motor vehicles. The intending buyer of a motor vehicle enters into a hire purchase agreement with the petitioner company. Under the terms of the agreement the hirer makes an initial deposit by way of premium as consideration for granting the lease of the vehicle, which deposit becomes the absolute property of the company. The hirer undertakes to pay instalments and when all the instalments are paid the vehicle becomes the property of the hirer at his option, on payment of rupee one to the company. Till the completion of the instalments the vehicle remains the property of the company as owners but the hirer is responsible for any damage or destruction or loss of the vehicle. Until the option is exercised the hirer is at liberty to return the vehicle and to put an end to the hiring agreement. The contract of hire purchase was entered into in Delhi, instalments were paid in Delhi, the option was exercised in Delhi but the goods were inside the State of Gujarat which taxed the sale.
 Section 2(28) of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act which defines sale enacts sale means the sale of goods made within the State for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration and includes any supply by a society or club or an association to its members on Payment of a price or of fees or subscription but does not include a mortgage, hypothecation, charge or pledge..... " The explanation to the definition states "For the purposes of this clause the sale within the State includes a sale determined to be inside the State in accordance with the Principles formulated in sub-section (2) of section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956." Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 enacts "A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place inside a State if the goods are within the State (a) in the case of specific or ascertained goods at the time the contract of sale is made.......
 On the question whether (1) the State of Gujarat could tax the sales and (2) whether a petition under Article 32 lies in this case Dismissing the petitions, 
HELD :-(a) In the present case the sale itself took place only when the hirer exercised his option to purchase and that was when the goods were inside the State of Gujarat and therefore, the State of Gujarat was entitled to levy tax on that transaction of sale. [392H-393A] There can be no objection to the incorporation in s. 2(28) of the Gujarat Act of the definition of sale inside the State contained in s. 4(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act.
 The Gujarat legislation could as well have incorporated the very words of s. 4(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act in the explanation to s. 2(28) and in either case it makes no difference. [392E] (b) There can be no objection to the State of Gujarat taxing what according to the Central State Tax Act is a sale inside the State of Gujarat. There can be no objection to a State making a sale of goods which are inside the State at the time the sale takes place liable to sales tax under its legislation. The fact that the contract of hire purchase was entered into in Delhi that the instalments were paid in Delhi and the option itself was exercised in Delhi does not make any difference to this result. All that it means is that the 387 agreement of sale was concluded in Delhi whereas the sale itself was completed by the property in the goods passing in Gujarat State and the sale therefore,. took place in Gujarat State. [392F-G] (c) There can be no objection the State of Gujarat levying a tax in respect of the same goods even though those goods may have been subject to tax earlier by the Delhi State.
 There is no rule that any goods can be subjected to tax only once. Even in respect of the same goods sales tax can: be levied as often as there are sales. [392G-H] Instalments Supply (p) Ltd. v. Union of India [1961] INSC 207; [1962] 2 SCR 644 referred to.
 (2) The constitutionality of s. 2(28) of the Gujarat Act has been, questioned and, therefore, the petition is 'maintainable. An application under Article 32 will lie (1) where action is taken under a statute which is ultra vires of the Constitution (2) where the statute is intra vires but the action taken is without jurisdiction and (3) where the action taken is procedurally ultra vires as where a quasi- judicial authority under an obligation to act judicially passes an order in violation of principles of natural justice. [1393F-H] [393 F-H] Ujjambai v. State of U.P., [1963] 1 S.C.R. 778 followed.
