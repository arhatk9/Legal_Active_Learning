 The appellant, a Returning Officer in the by-election to Fatehabad Assembly Constituency of Haryana State, rejected the nomination papers of two candidates. The election of the successful candidate was challenged on the ground that the nomination papers were improperly rejected.
 At the trial the successful candidate examined the appellant as R.W.3. While analysing the evidence of the appellant the High Court observed that the two nomination papers were in order when they were filed and subsequently they were tampered with when they were in the custody of the appellant and, therefore, his conduct in either tampering with the nomination papers himself or manipulating the tampering was guided by ill-motives. Consequently, the petition was accepted with costs and election of the successful candidate was declared void. As the conduct of the appellant was found to be motivated, half of the costs was ordered to be shared by him.
 The appellant appealed to this Court under s.116A of the of Representation People Act, 1951 seeking expunction of the observations as also the direction in regard to the costs.
 Allowing the Appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The appellant had acted appropriately in performance of his duty as Returning Officer and did not over-step the same; he was not responsible either directly or indirectly for making any alteration in the two nomination papers. The observations made by the High Court are, therefore vacated. The directions for sharing of costs stand also vacated being unwarranted. [621 A-B] 615 
 2. There was no justification at all for the High Court to come to the conclusion that the conduct of the Returning Officer was most depreciable. Until justifiable grounds are made out no evidence should be condemned. [620 G] 
 3. The High Court has lost sight of the position that there is a presumption that official acts have been regularly performed and the burden was on the person who pleaded to the contrary and sought a different conclusion to be reached. [620 H] 
 4. In the connected appeal against the decision of the High Court by which the election of the returned candidate was vacated, the judgment of the High Court has been reversed by taking a different view in the matter of appreciation of the evidence of Returning Officer, the appellant. [619C] 
 5. At the trial the election petitioners have failed to establish the alleged motivation for the rejection of the nomination papers. On a reference to the demeanour of the appellant as a witness, the alleged contradiction or variation between the orders of rejection and deposition in Court, the conclusion that appellant was responsible for the alteration of the proposer's serial number in the respective nomination papers has been reached. The Court by holding to the contrary has concluded that the Returning Officer was not a party to any alteration in the nomination papers and he had passed legitimate orders of rejection of nomination papers. It has been held that the inconsistent statements made by the Returning Officer when he was in the witness box were the outcome of confusion. A categorical finding has been recorded that the reason indicated for rejection of the nomination papers fits in with the defects appearing in the documents and the oral evidence given by the appellant. [620 C-E] 
 6. Under s.116A of the Act an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court on any question whether of law or fact from every order made by the High Court under s. 98 or 99. The appellant though not a party to the election petition can maintain the appeal on account of the direction for sharing the costs and the strictures to justify that direction. [619 D; E]
