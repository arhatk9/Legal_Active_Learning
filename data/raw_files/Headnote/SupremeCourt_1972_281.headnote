After such a notice, the Collector or the Government shall not be liable for any compensation Section II provides that the Collector may use force for enforcing his order made under this Act.
 In the appeals, the main question for determination was the scope ambit and interpretation of S. 7 read with S. 1 1 of the Act. It was contended by the appellants that under S.
 7, the Collector had no power to evict a lessee after the expiry of the lease. For that purpose Mort mug be had to the provisions of the Punjab Tenancy Act 1887, of the Genera Law.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) Section 7(1) of the Act cannot be read in isolation, but has to be interpreted in the light of the purpose and scheme of the Act ,as also the other relevant provisions. The sole purpose for which the Act was enacted was to ensure that such lands as were capable of producing food or fodder but which owing to the neglect on the part of the owners were not being cultivated, are utilised for cultivation. Under S. 3, the Collector is empowered to take possession of any cultivable land which remained fallow for the last six or more harvests. The Collector was to give a lease for the minimum period of 7 years, but not, more than 20 years. The tenant, however, knew beforehand that on the expiry the period of the lease, he would have to surrender possession to the owner.
 The Act, nowhere contemplated that the owner should be completely deprived of As ownership right. The compensation to which he was on titled under s. 4 was for the temporary deprivation of the exercise of his ownership rights. [1011 HI (ii)Section 7(1) when read in the context clearly shows that it was intended to empower the Collector to make an order in writing after the expiry of the lease saying that the 'possession of the land shall be given to the person named or specified in the order. The words, "to whom possession of land shall be given' contained the mandate under which the 1007 Collector derived powers of that the possession of the land was to be given by the tenant to the owner whose name was specified in the Collector's order. If the tenant did not comply with the order or direction made under & 7, the Collector could use such steps or force as was necessary compliance with the order. [1013 C] (iii)The answer to the question that eviction could take place only under the Tenancy Act or the general law, and not under Section 7(1) of the Act, is that the East Punjab Utilisation of Lands Act 1949 was intended to be exhaustive for the purpose for which it was enacted. it is hardly possible to regard a tenant of the Collector under the Act as falling within the definition of a 'tenant' under the Tenancy Act. The whole purpose of the Act would be defeated if the provisions of the Tenancy Act were made applicable to it. If that were the intention, the Tenancy Act were made applicable to it. If that were the intention, the legislature would have provided for it. As regards compensation, no provision has been made in the Act for payment of any compensation for great hardship by being asked to give up all lands, but that hardship could to alleviated, or some relief given by the legislature alone.
