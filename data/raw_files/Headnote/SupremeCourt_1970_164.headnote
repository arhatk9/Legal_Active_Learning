 The respondents were employees of B.E.S.T. running bus services in the city of Bombay. They were members of a Union known as B.E.S.T. Union which declared a strike in August, 1963. As a result several workers struck work but some disregarded the call for strike and continued to work.
 On the third day of the strike the respondents stopped a bus in operation and attacked and seriously injured the conductor and the driver of the bus as well as a police constable. The respondents were thereafter tried and convicted on various, charges and the trial judge imposed sentences of two years imprisonment on one respondent and one year imprisonment on the others. In their appeal to the High, Court the respondents did not challenge their conviction but only prayed for alteration of the sentences.
 The learned single judge, while agreeing with the findings of the trial court, took the view that the accused had acted on a sudden impulse and on account of heat and anger; that they did not belong to the regular class of criminals and in all the circumstances he directed the respondents to enter.
 into a bond under s. 5(1) (a) of the Bombay Probation of Offenders Act, 1938, for specified periods, instead of sentencing them to imprisonment.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The learned single judge seriously erred in applying the provisions of s. 5(1) (a) in the present case.
 The learned judge did not take into consideration the age or the physical or mental condition of the offenders. So far as the character of the accused was concerned, he could have considered it only in the context of what they did on the day of the occurrence. There was no other material before him. The offences committed by them showed that they were desperate characters. The only thing that the learned judge could be said to have considered were the circumstances in which the offences were committed. The fact that there was a call for strike is no ground for arson and assault of a grievous character. No section of the society can be permitted to take law into its own hand. There are ways to remedy social injustices. No individual can take upon himself the right to remedy any wrong done to him. It is impossible to have an orderly society, if we take to the ways of the jungle. There may be a genuine desire to change the present social order but that must and can be done through the instrumentalities of the State. In the final analysis. it is the people of this country through their representatives that must decide the social goals. if social wrongs are sought to be remedied in the streets, then there can be neither peace nor progress. Without progress the Sup.CI(P)/71-9 834 attainment of social justice is impossible. Under, our Constitution the rule of law has been made our way of life.
 It is a fallacy to think that rule of law and the law of the jungle can co-exist. [837 D-G] [As the period of the suspended sentences was over, the Court dismissed the appeal with the above observations].
