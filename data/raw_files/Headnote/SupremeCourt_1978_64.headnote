 In a suit for partition of the suit property, which was very small in dimension measuring .013 acres only filed by the plaintiff's-appellants, the trial Court by its judgment dated 14-8-1961 decreed the suit and in doing so took recourse to the provisions of S. 3 (2) of the Partition A 1893 as could not be con. veniently partitioned. The trial judge fixed the valuation of the suit premises at Rs.
 11,250/- and directed. "that the suit premises being incapable of partition shall be put to sale between the plaintiffs and the defendant, and the same shall be sold to that party who offers to pay the highest price above the valuation of Rs. 11,250/-". Since the highest bid in the last auction held by the Court in June 1965, was Rs.
 50,000'/- and by the plaintiffs the defendant was given an option to purchase the property at that price and deposit the sale money by July 1965. On his failure, the Court accepted the highest bid of the plaintiffs. Accepting the defendant-respondent's appeal, the High Court, held, "by making the averments in paragraphs 8 and 10(c) of this plaint, the plaintiffs have clearly made out a case to be dealt with u/s. 2 of the Act", and therefore, equity had to be worked out between the parties by allowing the defendant who was residing in the 1st floor and having a shop in the ground floor to purchase the share of the plaintiffs under the provisions of S. 3 (1) r/w S. 2 of the Act. Taking Rs.
 11,250/- as the price of the whole property in suit which was the valuation fixed by the trial Court. the High Court worked out the value of the plaintiffs' share as Rs.
 9,000/-, and that of the defendant as Rs. 2,250/- and further directed that the defendant be allowed to purchase the plaintiffs' share in the suit property.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave and remitting the case to the trial Court, the Court 
HELD : 1. Under s. 3 r/w S. 2 of the Partition Act, the Court can exercise the power u/s 3; y(i) there is a request of any of the shareholders interested individually or collectively to the extent of one moiety or upwards, for sale of the property and its distribution and (ii) it reaches an opinion that by reason of the nature of the property or the number of shareholders or some special circumstances, a division of the property cannot reasonably or conveniently be made and that a sale of the property, and distribution of the proceeds would be more beneficial for all the shareholders. From the word "may" it is clear that even when both the conditions are satisfied, the Court has discretion to direct ,or not to direct a sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds. The request contemplated is a sine qua non for directing a sale because such a request necessarily signified his willingness to have his share converted into money so that the co-shares may, by means of the procedure provided in S. 3, buy them out. The request for sale envisaged by s. 2 must be one for public sale. If no such request has been made to 'the Court s. 3 cannot be brought into operation.
 In the instant case, it is clear from pleadings, that neither in substance nor in form any request within the purview of s 2 had been made by any of the parties (co- shares). That condition precedent for invoking s. 3 (1) was larking The provisions of Ss. 2 and 3 of the Partition Act are therefore not applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the case. [470 F-H, 471 A-B, F-G] 2.In cases, not covered by Sections 2 and 3 of the Partition Act, the power ,of the Court to partition property by any equitable method is not affected by 468 the said Act. In a situation where it is found as a fact, that the suit property is so small that it cannot be conveniently and reasonably partitioned by nietes and bounds without destroying its intrinsic worth, the Court can devies such other feasible method for affecting partition as may appear to it to be just and equitable, in the circumstances of the case. In the instant case the suit proparty, being incapable of division in specie, there is no alternative but to resort to the process called Owelty, according to which the rights and interests of the parties in the property will be separated, only by allowing one of them to retain the whole of the suit property on payment of such compensation to the other as may be a just equivalent of his share. [471 G-H, 472 A-B) Ram Prasada Rao v. Subramanian, A.I.R. 1958 A.P. 647 approved.
 [The Court observing, that a more equitable method would be to take the value of the property as Rs. 50,000/- which was the highest bid in 1963 and to allow a reasonable increase for the rise in price, since 1963 upto this date, directed the Trial Court to dispose of the case in conformity with its observations after hearing the parties and after taking such further evidence as may be required preferably within three months from the date of its order]
