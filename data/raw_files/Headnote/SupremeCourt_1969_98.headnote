 Certain bye-laws framed by the Jabalpur Municipality, which permitted the slaughter of various animals including bulls -and bullocks, were confirmed by the respondent State Government in 1948. By a notification on January 12, 1967, in exercise of its powers under s. 430 of Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act 23 of 1956, the State Government cancelled the confirmation of certain bye-laws "insofar as the bye--laws relate to the slaughter of bulls and bullocks". The petitioner challenged the constitutionality of the notification by a writ petition under Art. 32 on the, ground that it infringed his fundamental right under Art.
 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.
 It was contended on behalf of the respondent State that (1) its power to rescind confirmation of the bye-laws could not be challenged by reference to Art. 14 or Art. 19 of the Constitution, because the power vested in the Government to confirm the bye-laws carried with it the power to rescind such confirmation; and (2) that since every person desiring to use a slaughter house, had to apply for and obtain a licence, which may be refused, and if given was liable to be withdrawn, no person may insist that he shall be given a licence to slaughter animals in a slaughter-house.
 
HELD: Allowing the petition, The, impugned notification, though technically within the competence of the State Government, directly infringed the fundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed by Art.
 19(1)(g). It could be upheld only if it was established that it sought to impose reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public and a less drastic restriction would not ensure the interest of the general public. [161 D] The sentiments of a section of the people may be hurt by permitting slaughter of bulls and bullocks in premises maintained by a local authority. But a prohibition imposed on the exercise of a fundamental right to carry on an occupation, trade or business will not be regarded as reasonable. if it is imposed not in the interest of the general public, but merely to respect the susceptibilities and sentiments of a section of the people whose way of life, belief or thought is not the same as that of the claimant.
 [161 H] The power to issue bye-laws indisputably includes the power to cancel or withdraw the bye-laws, but the validity of the exercise of the power to Issue and to cancel or withdraw the bye-laws must be adjudged in the light of its impact upon the fundamental rights of persons affected thereby. When the validity of a law placing restriction upon the exercise of fundamental rights in Art. 19(1) is challenged, the onus of proving to the satisfaction of the Court that the, restriction is reasonable lies upon the State. A law requiring that an act which is inherently dangerous, noxious or 157 injurious to public interest, health or safety or is likely to prove a nuisance to the community, shall be done under a permit or licence of an executive authority, is not per se unreasonable and no person may claim a licence or permit to do that act as of right. Where the law providing for grant of a licence or a permit confers a discretion upon an administrative authority regulated by rules or principles expressed or implied, and excersiable in consonance with rules of natural justice, it will be presumed to impose a reasonable, restriction. Where, however, power is entrusted to an administrative agency to grant or withhold a permit or licence in its uncontrolled discretion, the law ex facie infringes the fundamental right under Art. 19(1) [16O F] Mohd.
