 The appellant filed his nomination paper for election to the Lok Sabha but did not mention the Parliamentary Constituency from which he was contesting. The nomination form was in Hindi. Even though the Assistant Returning Officer drew his attention to the omission, the appellant did not cure the 
 that the defect was of a substantial character and rejected the nomination paper. In the appellant's election petition, the High Court held that the Returning Officer was justified in rejecting the nomination paper.
 Dismissing, the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Form on which the nomination of the appellant was made was the one which had been statutorily prescribed. It was not misleading or defective and in the present case, there was an omission to mention the name of the Parliamentary Constituency for which the appellant was being nominated as a candidate. [162F-G] Under the conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, Form means a form means a form appended to the Rules end includes a translation thereof in any of the languages used for the official purposes of the State. According to s. 5(1) of the Official Languages Act, 1963 a translation in Hindi published under the authority of the President in the Official Gazette shag be deemed to be the authoritative text in Hindi. The spaces to be filled in the Hindi form might cause confusion to a person unfamiliar with the language, but one familiar with the language will understand that the space provided in the Form is for filling in the name of the Parliamentary Constituency. In the present case, the proposer had not been misled by the Form, and the appellant, who actually filled it of before getting it signed to by the proposer, was informed of the defect in filling.,[160C- E; 161E-F,H] (2) This defect was essentially of a substantial character and did not fall within those provisions where the Returning Officer is enjoined either to get the defect rectified or ignore it. It was not the duty of the Returning Officer at the stage of scrutiny to draw the attention of the appellant to this substantial defect for the purpose of getting it cured, and ,he was fully justified in rejecting the nomination paper. [164 F-H] Under s. 36(2) (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the Returning Officer may reject a nomination on the ground 'that there has been a failure to comply with any of the provisions of s. 33 or s. 34. Section 33(1) provides that a nomination has to be presented after being completed in the prescribed form and signed by the candidate and by an elector of the Constituency as proposer. This requirement is mandatory and s., 36(4) clearly contemplates that where the defect is of a substantial character, the Returning Officer is not enjoined to have it rectified but has to reject the nomination paper.
