 A suit for recovery of possession of land under s. 209 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 was filed against the appellant. It was decreed by the trial court and the decree was affirmed by the first appellate court as well as by the High Court in second appeal.
 Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted to the appellant under Art. 136 of the Constitution. Thereafter the State Government issued a notification under s. 4 of the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 bringing the area in which the suit lands were situate, under consolidation operations. The appellant filed an application praying for an order that in view of s. 5 of the Consolidation of Holdings Act as amended by Act 21 of 1966 the appeal stood abated. On behalf of the respondent it was however urged :
 (i) that suits for recovery of possession of lands did not come within the purview of s. 5 as amended and hence no question of abatement arose; (ii) that if the amended section applied to the present proceedings the legislation being one by the State Legislature, was ultra vires inasmuch as it took away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to deal with the appeal.
 
HELD : (i) Suits for possession as such, have not been expressly referred to in the new s. 5; but the expression 'every suit and proceeding in respect of declaration of rights or interest in any land. . . .' is comprehensive enough to take in suits for possession of land, because, before a claim for possession is accepted, the court will have, necessarily, to :adjudicate upon the right or interest of the plaintiff, in respect of the -disputed property, taking into account the claim of the Opposite party. The various provisions contained in the Act also clearly indicate that disputes of the nature which existed between the parties in the present litigation, are now well within the- jurisdiction of the authorities constituted under the Act, to adjudicate upon. [100E-G] The suit filed by the respondent was therefore covered by s.
 5 of the Consolidation of Holdings Act.
 (ii) :Section 5 does not affect the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and is not ultra vires. What the State Legislature has done is only to make provision in respect of matters within its jurisdiction and declare that a suit, instituted' in a court, within its area has abated. The Position, ultimately is that this Court takes note of a subsequent event, viz.,, the passing of the Amending Act, and the amendment of s. 5 thereby by the State Legislature, and on that basis it holds that the suit, out of which these proceedings arise, stands abated.
