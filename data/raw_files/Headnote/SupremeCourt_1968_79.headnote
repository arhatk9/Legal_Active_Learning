 The appellant transported, between August 1953 and March 1955 certain materials in execution of a contract to supply goods for use by the Government of India. The respondent Municipality collected toll while the appellant's trucks were passing through the toll barrier. The appellant obtained in June 1955 a certificate from the authority concerned that the goods transported were "meant for Government work and had become the property of the Government". The appellant then applied to the Municipality for refund of the amount paid pursuant to the exemption granted by the Government Order under s. 157(3) of the U.P.
 Municipalities Act, 1916. The respondent declined to refund the amount. In an action against the respondent the trial court decreed the claim. In appeal the Civil Judge decreed the claim only for the amount paid after December 13. 1954.
 The High Court affirmed the order of the Civil Judge. Both the Civil Judge and the High Court took the view that by the Rules framed under the Act an application for refund within six months from the date of actual payment is a condition precedent for refund of the toll. - Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : The Civil Judge and the High Court exalted, what were merely matters of procedure which the Municipality was entitled to require compliance with in granting refund, into conditions precedent for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. The rules framed by the Government relating to the procedure to be followed in giving effect to the exemptions on April 15, 1939, do not purport to bar the jurisdiction of the Civil Court if the procedure is not followed. If these procedural requirements are not fulfilled, the Municipality may decline to refund the toll and relegate the claimant to a suit. It would then be open to the party claiming a refund to seek the assistance of the Court, and to prove by evidence which is in law admissible, that the goods transported by him fell within the order issued under a. 157(3) of the Act.
