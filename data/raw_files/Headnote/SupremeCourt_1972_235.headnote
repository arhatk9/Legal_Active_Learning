 The appellant assessee is a partner in A. & Co. Managing Agency of one textile Mill was assigned by the Managing Agents (S. & Co.) to A. & Co. for consideration of buying large number of shares and cash transferred in his favour by his brother. In 1946, the appellant sold 43,700 shares resulting in the profit of Rs. 1,51,927. Before the income Tax Officer the appellant's contention was that the surplus was in the nature of capital gains. The I.T.O. however, held that the amount was liable to taxation u/s 10 of the Act as profits on the sale of shares. The tribunal remanded the case to the I.T.O. The appeal along with the remand report was placed before the Tribunal for heading. After carefully considering all the evidence the Tribunal held that the shares were purchased not as stock-in-trade but for securing the managing agency and control of the company.
 The Tribunal further held that the surplus on sale of shares is not income which is liable to income tax under sec. 10.
 Thereafter, the Tribunal, on the High Court's direction drew up a statement of case u/s 62 (2). The High Court reversed the findings of the Tribunal and held against the appellant.
 
HELD : There was enough material and evidence referred, to by the Tribunal while recording its finding that the shares in question had been purchased by the assessee with a view to acquire the managing agency and control of the textile mill and that the shares did not constitute stock-in-trade of the assessee. It is for the Tribunal to decide the question of fact and the High Court in a reference u/s 66 of the Act cannot go behind the Tribunal's finding of fact.
 The High Court can only lay down the law applicable to the facts of the case found by the Tribunal. The High Court and the Supreme Court, in an appeal against the judgment of the High Court, in a reference u/s 66 of the Act are not constituted courts of appeal. These courts only exercise advisory jurisdiction in such references. Only in case where the finding is not based on any relevant evidence or is based on conjectures or suspicion, a question of law is raised and interference with the finding of facts is permissible. The High Court was not justified in setting aside the finding of fact in the instant case. [457C] On facts we are of the opinion that the profit made by the sale of shares constituted capital gain chargeable to income tax u/s 12 (b). Indeed it was the prayer of the assessee himself in his letter dated March 30, 1949.
