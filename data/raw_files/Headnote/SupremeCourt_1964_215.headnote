 The respondents submitted return of their turn-over under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, and claimed exemption in respect of certain transactions on the ground that they were commission sales exempted under the Act. The Deputy Commercial Tax Officer granted the exemption and assessed tax only on the rest of the turn-over. The Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, called for the record of the case and in exercise of the powers under s. 12(2) (i) of the Act and r. 14A of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules, directed fresh enquiry in respect of the exemption, issued a notice calling upon the assessee to show cause against the proposed revision, heard objections and on the basis of fresh evidence came to the conclusion that the respondents did, not act as commission agents but carried on the business of outright purchase and sale in respect of the, entire turnover. He therefore revised the order of assessment. The assesses' appeal to the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal was allowed. The State invoked the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court. The High Court held that in dealing with a proceeding under s. 12(2), the revising authority is restricted to the record before the assessing authority and the order passed on fresh evidence could not be sustained. It also held that r. 14A which authorised the revising authority to correct the amount of tax payable after making such enquiry as the authority considers necessary was ultra vires the Act. The State appealed to the Supreme Court and contended that the High Court had erred in declaring the rule ultra vires 
HELD (per Shah and Sikri JJ.) : The order passed by the High Court declaring r. 14A to be ultra vires should be set aside and the proceedings remanded to the High Court for disposal according to law. [613 A].
 Under s. 12(2) (i) the revising authority may call for the record of the order or the proceeding and the record alone may be scrutinised for ascertaining the legality or propriety of an order or the regularity of the proceeding.
 If after perusing the record the authority is prima facie satisfied about the illegality or impropriety or irregularity, it may under r. 14A, before passing an order, direct an additional enquiry. The validity of the rule even though it is directed to have effect as if enacted in the Act, is always open to challenge on the ground that it is unauthorised But there is nothing in the Act prohibiting the revising authority from making or directing a further enquiry before passing an order in revision, once it is satisfied on the record about the existence of the illegality, impropriety or irregularity. The Act, while conferring revisional jurisdiction under s. 12, leaves it to the State Government by rules framed under s. 19, to prescribe the procedure to be followed by the authority. A provision authorising the revising authority to make a further enquiry for effectively exercising his jurisdiction must be regarded as a provision validly conferring power unless it expressly or by clear implication nullifies, or is inconsistent with any provision of the Act. The matter should however be remanded to the High Court to make an enquiry whether in the circumstances of the 602 case, the Deputy Commissioner was competent to proceed in the manner he had done and to pass the order in revision.
 For, while the revisional jurisdiction is not restricted only to cases of arithmetical errors, it would not invest the authority with power to launch upon enquiries at large so as either to trench upon the powers which are expressly reserved by the Act or by the rules to other authorities, or to ignore the limitations inherent in the exercise of the power. [608 F, H; 609 A, D-E, G-H. 611 G-H. 612 A, D, H].
 Per Subba Rao J. (dissenting) : Rule 14A in so far as it confers a power on the revising authority to make a fresh enquiry and to determine on the basis of the enquiry the correct amount of tax payable is void, because, while the jurisdiction under s. 12(2) is clearly limited to the scrutiny of the order passed or the proceedings recorded by the inferior authority, and the scope of the scrutiny is confined to the question of legality or propriety of the order or the regularity of the proceedings, the rule obviously enlarges the enquiry beyond the limits prescribed.
