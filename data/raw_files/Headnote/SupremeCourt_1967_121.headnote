 The plaintiff-respondents obtained a lease from defendant 1- appellant. of certain rights in the estate of defendant 1, and paid him the lease money. By a notification published in the Official Gazette, the estate of defendant 1-appellant was vested in the defendant 2-State under the Bihar Land Reforms Act. Thereupon, the State called upon the plaintiff to pay the lease-money to it, which the plaintiff did under protest. The plaintiff filed a suit claiming the refund of the lease-money from either of the defendants, which he had been forced to pay to each of the defendants. The trial court decreed the suit against the State. The State appealed, and the High Court held defendant I was liable lo refund the money and set aside the decree against the State.
 In appeal,. this Court 
HELD : Defendant I had the right to collect the lease-money and not the State.
 There was no publication in two issues of two newspapers as required by s. 3(2) of the Act when the notification was published in the Official Gazette. This omission brought about non-compliance with the mandatory provision of s. 3(2) requiring publication in at least two issues of two newspapers with the result that s. 5(a) of the Act did not become applicable at that time and, consequently, defendant No. 1 continued to tie the proprietor and was not divested of his rights in the estate by this notification at that stage. On the record of this case, no material was forthcoming to show that the notification was ever published in any newspapers even subsequently; but, in the lower courts, the case proceeded on the basis of the admission by defendant I himself that he was dispossessed an a later date and it was with effect from that later (late he was divested of his proprietory rights. Consequently, he bad the. full right to grant the lease to the plaintiff on the relevant earlier date and the rights under that lease were exercised by the plaintiff during the. period when defendant I was still the proprietor.[1772 H-773 D] The direction in sub-s. (2) of s. 3 of the Act for publication of the notification in at least two issues of two newspapers was mandatory and not merely directory. The notification had a far reaching effect. it deprived the owner of his vested rights as a proprietor of the estate and vested those rights in the State Government. This alteration in the rights was to be brought about by notifications issued in respect of individual estates of a proprietor and it appears that it was because of this importance of the notification that the legislature did not consider it sufficient that the notification should be published in the Official Gazette only. If the intention of the Legislature was that the publication in the two newspapers need not be taken into account in order to attract the provisions of s. 4(a) of the Act, this intention could have been clearly expressed by laying down in the principal part of s. 4 itself that the Sup CI/67- 5 760 consequences were to ensue "on the publication of the notification under sub-s. (1) of s. 3 in the Official Gazette. By not qualifying the word " publication" in this section with the adjectival clause "in the Official Gazette", the Legislature must be held to have clearly indicated that The notification must 'be published fully in accordance with the manner laid down in sub-s. (2) of s. 3 of the Act. So far as the date of vesting is concerned, its definition could not naturally depend on all the five minimum publications envisaged in sub-s. (2) of s. 3. There was no certainty that the publication of the notification in either of those two issues of the. newspapers would be on the same date on which the notification is published in- the Official Gazette nor could there be any certainty that in the two issues of the other newspaper also, the notification would be published on the same date. In these circumstances, it was obviously necessary to lay down the exact date with effect from which the vesting of the estate in the State Government was to take effect. That is the reason 'why the date of vesting was defined in s. 2(h) of the Act and it laid down that the date of vesting is to be the date of publication in the official' Gazette. This definition was, therefore, incorporated to make it sure 'that the date of vesting in every case could be determined without, any uncertainty, or ambignity and the vesting will only come into force and effect after the notification is actually published in at least two issues of two newspapers as required by sub-s. (2) of s. 3 of the Act. [764 F-H 765 F-766E] The fact that the amendment of sub-s. (2) of s. 3 was not made retrospective can only lead to the inference that, though the legislature, after the passing of the Amending Act, did away with the necessity of publication of the notification in the newspapers, it did not retrospectively make effective those notifications, in respect of which there had been failure to comply with the requirements of sub-s. (2) of s. 3, by omitting the publication in two issues of two newspapers. [770 E-G] Raza Buland Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Board, Rampur, [1964] INSC 245; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 970, referred to.
