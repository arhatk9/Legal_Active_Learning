 The appellant, a public limited company, carries on the business of the manufacture and sale of flashlights (torches). It used to purchase aluminium slugs and produce aluminium cans or torch bodies at its factory by a process of extrusion. The Superintendent of Central Excise required the appellant to submit a price list in respect of the aluminium cans for the purpose of levying excise duty under section 4 of the Act. The appellant, anxious to avoid coercive action, filed a price declaration in which the price of aluminium cans was calculated at the cost of production plus a margin of profit of 5% of the cost.
 However, it contended before the Excise Authority (i) that aluminium cans cannot be described as "goods" for the purposes of excise duty inasmuch as they are not marketable and are prepared for the flashlights manufactured by it; and (ii) that the preparation of aluminium cans out of aluminium slugs did not amount to manufacture, and that aluminium cans were merely an intermediate product in the manufacture of flashlights. These contentions before the Excise Authority having failed, it filed a writ petition in the High Court. A Single Judge allowed the writ petition but a Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal of the respondent holding that the production of aluminium cans from aluminium slugs amounted to manufacture and that the aluminium cans could be described as "goods" for the purposes of the Act.
 Allowing the appeal, 163 ^ 
 HELD: 1. The aluminium cans produced by the appellant are not capable of sale to a consumer. They cannot be described as excisable goods and, therefore, do not fall within the terms of section 3 of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 read with Entry 27 of the First Schedule thereto. [167 G] 
 2. The excise duty is an indirect tax in which the burden of the imposition is passed on to the ultimate consumer. In that context, the expression "goods manufactured or produced" must refer to articles which are capable of being sold to a consumer. [166 B-C] Union of India v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills, [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 586 and South Bihar Sugar Mills Ltd. etc. v.
 Union of India & Ors., [1968] INSC 29; [1968] 3 S.C.R. 21, relied upon.
 In the instant case, the aluminium cans prepared by the appellant are employed entirely by it in the manufacture of flashlights, and are not sold as aluminium cans in the market. The record discloses that the aluminium cans, at the point at which excise duty has been levied, exist in a crude and elementary form incapable of being employed at that state as a component in a flashlight. The cans have sharp uneven edges and in order to use them as a component in making flashlight cases the cans have to undergo various processes such as trimming, threading and redrawing. After the cans are trimmed, threaded and redrawn they are reeded, beaded and anodised or painted. It is at that point only that they become a distinct and complete component, capable of being used as a flashlight case for housing battery cells and having a bulb fitted to the case. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that the elementary and unfinished form in which they exist immediately after extrusion suffices to attract a market. No satisfactory material to the contrary has been placed by the respondents. The record discloses that whatever aluminium cans are produced by the appellant are subsequently developed by it into a completed and perfected component for being employed as flashlight cases.
