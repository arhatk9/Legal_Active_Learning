 In a suit for partition of bakash land a preliminary decree was passed. The defendants-appellants, claiming to be in actual possession of the bakasht land, filed a petition contending that the consequence of s. 6. of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 (which came into force in the meanwhile) was to put an end to the proprietor's possession of the bakasht land by causing them to vest in the State and simultaneously creating a tenancy in favour of the person in khas possession thereof, and therefore, no final decree could be passed. The trial court accepted the contention and dismissed the plaintiff's application for passing final decree. In appeal, the High Court set aside the order.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Even if the appellants were in actual khas possession within the meaning of s. 2(k) of the Act, it must be held that the plaintiff respondent, who was a co-sharer, was in constructive possession through the appellants, as, under the law, possession of one co-sharer is possession of all co-shares. The appellants did not claim to be trespassers on the property neither did they claim any title to the lands adversely to the respondent. The deeming provision of s. 6 must, therefore, enure for the benefit of all, who in the eye of land) would be regarded as in actual possession.
 Therefore, the respondent had not lost his share in the bakasht lands and had a right to his share in them, though not as tenure-holder or proprietor, but as a raiyat under the provisions of the Act. [645 E-G] P. L. Reddy v. L. L. Reddy, [1956] INSC 81; [1957] S.C.R. 195, 202, followed.
