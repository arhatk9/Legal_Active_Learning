 The appellant obtained from her father under a gift a piece of land admeasuring 27 acres and 37 gunthas. As owner of the land she served a notice dated March31, 1962 on the tenant informing him of her intention to terminate his tenancy of the land on the ground that she required the land bonafide for her personal cultivation. On March 30, 1963 she filed an application before the Naib Tahsildar under s.
 36 read with s. 39 of the Bombay Tenancy & Agricultural Lands (Vidarbha Region) Act (Bombay Act 99 of 1958) for termination of the tenancy of the tenant and for directing him to surrender possession of the entire land. Later the application was amended to include an alternative plea for being given possession of half the land in question in case possession of the entire land could not be given. The tenant resisted the application. The Naib Tahsildar held :
 (1) that the application filed by the landlord under s. 36 read with s. 3.9 was maintainable and that the notice issued by her on March 31, 1962 was valid; (2) that the landlord was born on July 6, 1944 and attained majority on July 6, 1962; (3) that under s. 39 (as interpreted by the Naib Tahsildar) the landlord was entitled to file the application within one year after her attaining majority and in this case the application had been filed within that time; (4) that there were oral leases granted by the mother of the landlord in favour of the tenant from 1951 onwards and that the tenant bad also executed a kabuliyat in favour of the landlord represented by her mother on February 12, 1956 for the year 1956-57 and that he had been in possession of the land as tenant even during the period 1958-59; (5) that since, however, the father of the landlord was alive, and was in law her natural guardian, the leases granted by the mother were not valid; (6) that, nevertheless, since the tenant was in occupation of the land during 1958-59 he was a deemed tenant under s. 6 of Bombay Act 99 of 1958; (7) that since the deemed tenancy arose after April 1, 1957 the landlord was entitled to get relief under s. 39 of the Act;
 (8) that the landlord had no other land and no other source of income and the suit land were less than a family holding.
 In the result the Naib Tahsildar ordered that the possession of the entire land be granted to the appellant. The order was confirmed by the Sub-Divisional Officer and substantially confirmed by the Revenue Tribunal. 'These three orders were challenged by the tenant in a writ petition under Act 227 of the Constitution. The High Court taking into account the finding of the Revenue Tribunal that the appellant's 2 father was not taking any interest in his minor daughter's affairs and the mother was looking after her and managing her properties, held that in the circumstances the mother must be considered the natural guardian. Consequently in the High Court's view the lease granted by the mother on February 12, 1956 was legal and valid. The lease being one recorded prior to April 1, 1957, s. 39 was not attracted.
 The High Court further held that since the application under s. 39 was not filed within one year of the coming into force of Bombay Act 99 of 1958, it was time-barred. However treating the application as one under s. 38 of the Act the High Court remanded the case to the Naib Tahsildar to give effect to its view that the appellant was entitled to resume for cultivation one third of the family holding or half of the land leased by her whichever was more. Appeal against the High Court's order Was filed in this Court by special leave. The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether the High Court had exceeded its jurisdiction under Art. 227; (ii) whether the appellant's mother was entitled in law to grant a lease of her land and whether the tenancy of the tenant was one created prior to April 1, 1957 to which s. 39 was not applicable; (iii) whether the application under s. 39 was barred by limitation.
 
HELD : (i) The powers of the High Court under Art. 227 are not greater than the powers under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The powers of interference under Art. 227 are limited to seeing that the tribunals function within the limits of their authority and that the High Court cannot sit in appeal against the order of a tribunal in a petition under Art. 227. In the present case the High Court could not be said to have 'exceeded its jurisdiction under Art.
 227 because it was only on two material aspects of the case which, affected the jurisdiction of the tribunals to grant relief, namely, (a) the power of the mother, on the facts found by the tribunals, to giant the lease on behalf of the minor daughter and (b) the maintainability of the application under s. 39 of the Act, that the High Court had differed 'from the tribunals.

 ShankarSingh & Anr. C.A. No. 35/1966 dt. 17-3-1966, applied.
 (ii) Though from 1951 to 1956 the leases were oral, for the year 1956-57 a written lease was executed by the tenant in favour of the appellant represented by her mother. It is no doubt true that the father was alive but he was not taking any interest in the affairs of the minor and it was as good as if he was non-existent so far as the minor appellant was concerned. The High Court was therefore right in holding that in the particular circumstances of this case the mother could be considered be the natural guardian of her minor daughter. This was the position in Hindu law both before and after the passing of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. [8 E-H] There was evidence to establish that the transaction in question was in any way imprudent or not in the interest of the minor. [9 A-D] The leases granted by the mother being valid, the tenancy was clearly one granted before April 1, 1957 to which s. 39 was not applicable. [9 E] (iii) Section 39 being inapplicable the question whether the appellant's application under that section was within the period of limitation did not arise for consideration.
 [10 B-C] (iv) The High Court even after holding that s. 39 did not apply had shown consideration to the appellant by treating her application as one 3 tinder s. 36 read with s. 38. Applying s. 38 the appellant would not be entitled to the possession of the entire field.
 As per el. (a) proviso (i) of sub-sec. (4) of s. 38 she would be entitled to resume for personal cultivation either one-third of the family holding or half of the lands leased by her, whichever was more. On this basis the directions given by the High Court in remanding the case to the Naib Tahsildar were correct. [10 D-F]
