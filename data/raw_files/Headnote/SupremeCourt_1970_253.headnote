 On the promulgation of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Princely States adjoining the Dominion of India merged with the Dominion of India. The instruments of merger provided for_the integration of the States and guaranteed to the Rulers the Privy Purse, succession according to law and custom to the gaddi of the State and personal rights, privileges, dignities and titles. These instruments were concurred in and guaranteed by the Dominion of India.
 Later, the States integrated with the Union of India under the Constitution of India, 1950, the Rulers abandoning all authority in regard to their territories. Special provisions were enacted in the Constitution regarding Privy Purses and the rights and privileges of the erstwhile Rulers. By article 291, the sum-, guaranteed by the Dominion of India to any Ruler as Privy Purse under any covenant or agreement was to be charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund of India and the. sums so paid were to be exempt from all taxes on income. By article 362 the Parliament, the State Legislatures and the executive of the Union and the States were enjoined to have due regard to the guarantees and assurances under the covenants and agreements between the Governments of the Dominion of India and the heads of the former Indian States. Also, provisions were made in various statutes conferring on the "Rulers" certain privileges and benefits. By Art. 366(22) a "Ruler" was defined to mean the prince, chief or other person by whom covenant and agreements. were entered into and who "for the time being" was recognised by the President as the Ruler and included any person who "for the time being" 10 was recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler. Article 363 excluded the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and all other courts "in respect of any dispute arising out of any provision of a treaty, agreement, covenant etc." or in any dispute "in respect of any right accruing under or any liability or obligation arising out of any of the provisions of the Constitution relating to any such treaty, agreement, covenant" etc.
 On September 2, 1970, a Bill intituled the Constitution (Twenty Fourth Amendment) Bill 1970, and providing that "Articles 291 and 362 of the Constitution and clause (22) of article 366 shall be omitted" was introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Bill was declared passed. On September 5, 1970, the motion for consideration of the Bill did not obtain in the Rajya Sabha the requisite majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting as required by Art. 368 of the Constitution. The motion for introduction of the Bill was declared lost. A few hours thereafter the President of India, purporting to exercise power under cl. (22) of Art. 366 of the Constitution signed an instrument withdrawing recognition of all the Rulers. A communication to the effect was sent to all Rulers in India who had been previously recognised under art. 366(22) of the Constitution.
 The petitioners moved this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging the order of the President "derecognising" them as unconstitutional, ultra vires and void. They contended that the President had no power to withdraw recognition of Ruler once recognised; that assuming the President had such power, exercise of the power was coupled with duty to recognise his successor; that the order of the President "derecognsing" all the Rulers en masse amounted to arbitrary exercise of power for a collateral purpose; that the Order violated the constitutional mandates in articles 291 and 362; that article 291 created an obligation in the Union of India to pay the Privy Purse and Privy Purse was property; and that the Order being one without authority of law infringed the guarantee of the fundamental rights under Arts. 19(1)(f), 21 and 31 of the Constitution. The Union of India contended, inter alia, that the petition was not maintainable, because, the source of the right to receive the Privy Purse and to be accorded the privileges claimed was a political agreement and the privy purse was in the nature of a political pension; that in recognising or derecognising a ruler the President exercised a political power which was a sovereign power and that the rights and obligations were liable to by varied or repudiated in accordance with "State policy"; that the jurisdiction of the Courts to enforce rights and obligations arising out of the covenant was excluded, because, the rights and obligations arose out of act of state; that the concept of paramountly of the British Crown was inherited by the Union of India and therefore recognition of Rulership was a "gift of the President"; and further that the petitioners stood excluded by article 363, for, they were seeking either to enforce the covenants and agreements or were seeking to enforce the provisions of the Constitution "relating to" such covenants.
 
HELD: Per Hidayatullah, C.J. Shah, Vaidialingam, Hedge, Grover and Dua, JJ. (Mitter and Ray, JJ. dissenting).
 The Order of the President "derecognising" the Rulers is ultra vires and illegal. [69 G; 100 C] (Per Hidayatullah, C.J. (1) The action of the President withdrawing recognition of all Rulers is ultra vires article 366(22) and a nullity. Article 366(22) neither expressly nor by implication places the power in the hands of the President to say that although a Ruler is in existence or 11 a successor is available there shall be no ruler of any particular state. The definition contemplates the existence of the Ruler "for the time being". The phrase "for the time being" cannot mean that any person can be appointed who has no claim whatever or that temporary appointments may be made or that no appointment need be made. The continuity of a Ruler of an Indian State is obligatory so long as the Ruler is alive or a successor can be found. The obligation to recognise a Ruler is bound up with the other guarantees contained in articles 291 and 362 and the definition in article 366(22) is merely the key to find a particular Ruler. The withdrawal of recognition from all the Rulers renders the guarantees, as also the relevant articles of the Constitution, inoperative. [58 A-H] (ii) The right to recognise a ruler, from out of several claimants, is not an act of paramountcy. The selection has to be in accordance with law and custom. The Constitution gave the right to the President to recognise a Ruler for the time being; but it cannot be stretched to give a paramountly of the same character as that enjoyed by the British Crown.
 To claim such a paramountcy one has to, ignore completely the arrangements by which the Rulers parted with their territories and ruling rights and were assured of their privy purses and privileges. The rights became consti- tutionally protected rights which so long as the Ruler's line was not extinct belonged to the Ruler "for the time being. In short, when the guarantees were given by the Constitution, paramountcy if any, went out. Article 362 is the converse of paramountcy inasmuch as it compels the two limbs of government to have "due regard"' to the guarantees and assurances given to the Rulers. Nor can article 363 be said to "recreate" paramountcy. That article was intended to keep certain matters outside the jurisdiction of the courts. The Rulers are citizens of India and the President or the Government of India cannot invoke the doctrine of paramountcy to sustain an illegal inroad upon the rights of citizens. [51 H-52 B] (iii) The argument based on act of state is not of any more validity. An 'Act of State' is not available against a citizen. It is a sovereign act which is neither grounded in law nor does it pretend to be so. It is "a catastrophic change constituting a new departure". Since there are no sovereign or political powers under our Constitution every action of the executive limb of government must seek justification in some law. The very existence of article 363, which it is said incorporates some kind of paramountcy or act of state, shows that there is no political power outside the law; otherwise an additional bar would hardly have been necessary.

 (iv) Covenants and agreements cannot be said to create "imperfect obligations" since the Constitution takes the matter into itself and gives them its own guarantees. In so far as those guarantees became a part of our Constitution and were included in various statutes they would be en- forceable according to the tenor of the Constitution and other laws subject, of course, to any bar created by article 363.

 L744Sup CI/71 12 (v) It is not open to the petitioner to describe the action of the President as wanting in good faith without pleading any collateral fact. Further, the reasons for a decision by the President cannot be probed into in view of articles 74(2) and 361(1). [56 E] (vi) The argument on behalf of the Union of India that article 291 only lays down the source and manner of payment but creates no right to claim, receive or enforce payment is a complete misreading of the article. Article 291 makes the amount payable to the Ruler and, therefore, creates a right in him to demand it. The words "shall be charged and paid out of etc." make the payment obligatory and when expanded the words read "shall be charged on and shall be paid out of" etc. The direction to pay is in no uncertain terms.
 The recipient is mentioned in cl. (b) where the article says 'and the sums so paid to any Ruler' and this shows who is to be paid. Therefore, the Article in addition to the source and manner also lays down that it shall be paid and paid free of taxes on income to the Ruler. The article is self- supporting and self-ordaining. The result of charging a sum on the Consolidated Fund is to provide that this destination shall not be altered even by vote of Parliament and the charging is sufficiently effective for ensuring the right application. [62 D-63 B] (vii) Article 363 does not bar relief to the petitioners. The words provisions of this Constitution' in the latter part of article 363 arc not left unqualified.
 The draftsmen would have referred to the numbers of the articles if disputes of every kind under those articles stood excluded. The requirement is that it must be a provision "relating" to a treaty, covenant etc. The words 'relating to' mean that the provision must bear upon treaties etc. as its dominant purpose or theme; it is not sufficient if treaties are mentioned there for some collateral purpose. So tested, [65 D-E] (a) Article 362 is a provision relating to a treaty, covenant etc. Its dominant theme is 'the rights, privileges and dignities of the Rulers under covenants and agreements and, therefore the provision is one relating to covenants and agreements. [65 G-H] (b) Article 366(22) has for its dominant purpose the selection of Rulers through the application of the covenant and agreements. When the President acts-within the four corners of his authority the matter is barred by article 363. What the President has done is to take away recognition 'from all Rulers and such a power does not flow from article 366(22) and the bar of article 363 does not apply to such a dispute. The dispute arises neither from the covenants etc. nor from the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, it ceases to have the protection of article 363. [66 C H] (c) Article 291 is not a provision relating to covenants and agreements but a special provision for the source of payment of Privy Purse by charging them on the Consolidated Fund and for making the payment free of taxes on income; it does not in its dominant purpose and theme answer the description in the latter part of article 363. The mention in Art. 291 of covenants and agreements is for its own purpose so that the amounts need not be specified. [67 H-68 B] [His Lordship did not express any opinion on the question whether withdrawal of recognition on grounds which are sound and sufficient is capable of being questioned in a court of law.] 13 (viii) The petitions are maintainable under article 32 of the Constitution. The obligation to pay the Privy Purse being absolute the right to claim when due subsists in each ruler. As soon as an appropriation Act is passed there established credit-debt and the outstanding Privy Purse becomes the property of the Ruler in the hands of the government. It is also a sum certain and absolutely payable. Therefore Privy Purse is property and any action to deprive the Rulers of their Privy Purses must be an infringement of articles 19 and 31.

 (Per Shah, Sikri, Shelat, Bhargava, Vaidialingam, Grover and Dua, JJ.) (1) By the provisions enacted in article 366(22), 291 and 362 of the Constitution, the privileges of Rulers are made an integral part of the Constitution and they cannot be deprived of these privileges arbitrarily. Granting that under clause (22) of Art. 366 the President may withdraw the recognition of a person as a Ruler, the power to nullify important provisions of the Constitution does not flow 'from that clause. The power conferred by the clause has to be exercised consistently with and in aid of the constitutional scheme. The power may be exercised, in the case of first recognition, only in favour of a person who has signed the Covenant, and in favour of his successor having, regard to the customs and laws governing the state if the Ruler dies or becomes incapable of functioning or his recognition is withdrawn. By the use of the expression "for the time being" in cl. (22) Art. 366 the President is not invested with an authority to accord a temporary recognition to a Ruler nor with authority to recognise or not to recognise a Ruler arbitrarily; the expression predicates that there shall be a Ruler of the Indian State, that if the first recognised Ruler dies or ceases to be a Ruller a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers at a given time. By the express injunction in Art. 53(1) the executive power vested in the President is directed to be exercised in accordance with the Constitution.
 Therefore, the power is intended to be exercised in aid of and not to destroy constitutional institutions. The power is plainly coupled with duty-a duty. to maintain con- stitutional institutions, the constitutional provisions, the constitutional scheme and the sanctity of the solemn agreements entered into by the predecessor of the Union Government, which are accepted, recognised and incorporated in the Constitution. An order merely "derecognising" a Ruler without providing for continuation of the institution of Rulership, which is an integral part of the Constitutional scheme, is, therefore, plainly illegal. [74 C; 81 H-82 D, E; 83 A] [The Court did not express any final opinion on the question whether the expression "for the time being" in relation to the persons who had entered into covenants or agreements.
 and in relation to the successor, implies that the President has the power in appropriate cases and for adequate reasons to withdraw recognition. Also, the Court did not decide the question whether in certain exceptional circumstances the President may in granting recognition to a successor depart in the larger interest of the country from the strict rule of custom governing succession to the, gaddi. [74 B-C; 82 G- H] 14 (ii) The President is not invested with any political power, transcending the Constitution which he may exercise to the prejudice of citizens. The Constitutional mechanism in a democratic polity does not contemplate existence of any function which may qua the citizens be designated as political. The history of negotiations which culminated in the integration of the territories of the Princely States before the commencement of the Constitution clearly indicates that the recognition of the status of the Rulers and their rights was not temporary and also not liable to be varied or repudiated in accordance with "State policy". Nor does the Constitution invest the executive branch of the Union with the power to abolish the concept of Rulership, Privy Purse and the privileges on the plea that these have become incompatible with "democracy, equality ,and social justice". The power of the President to determine the status of the Rulers by cancelling or withdrawing recognition to effectuate the policy of the Government to abolish the concept of Rulership is therefore liable to be challenged in these petitions.

 (iii) An action not authorised by law against the citizens of the Union cannot be supported under the shelter of paramountly. After the withdrawal of British power and the extinction of paramountcy of the British the Dominion Government of India. did not and could not exercise any paramountcy over the States. The functions of the President of India stem from the Constitution, not from a "concept of the British Crown" identified or unidentified. What the Constitution does not authorise, the President cannot grant.
 Rulership is therefore not a privilege which the President may in the exercise of his discretion bestow or withhold.[94 C-D] (iv) Clause (a) of article 291 which enacts that the Privy Purse "shall be charged on and be paid out of the Consolidated Fund of India" clearly raise an obligation to pay the Privy Purse. A charge gives a right to receive payment out of a specified fund or property in preference over others. In the absence of clear indications to the contrary it would be difficult to hold that the expression "charge" used in the context of the financial matters of the state has a different meaning. The Constitution does not recognise any sequence of priorities. But that does not alter the fundamental character of a charge that it specifies a fund out of which satisfaction of the expenditure charged must be made and that the prescribed expenditure shall have priority in payment to the person for whose benefit the expenditure is charged on the Fund. The Constitutional obligation to proceed in the manner set out in Arts. 112, 113 & 114 imposed upon the President and the Parliament, implies, a right in the person or persons in respect of whom the expenditure is to be incurred. That view is supported by other provisions in the Constitution.
 Clauses (a) & (b) of Art. 291 must be read with articles 112, 113 and 114; they are parts of a single scheme. They contemplate that the Privy Purse shall be included in the financial statement as charged upon the Consolidated Fund;
 it shall be beyond the voting power of the Parliament; its destination shall not be altered: it shall be paid to the Ruler after the Appropriation Bill is passed, and 15 when paid it shall be free from liability to pay taxes on income. This is an integrated process, which cannot be interrupted without dislocating the constitutional mechanism. [87 A; 88 B; 88 E & 89 D] Govind Chandra Pal v. Dwarka Nath Pal, I.L.R. 35 Cal. 837 and Raja Sri Shiva Prasad v. Beni Madhab, I.L.R. I Pat. 387, referred to.
 (v) Article 291 does not merely incorporate recognition of the obligation to pay privy purse under covenants incurred by the Government of the Dominion of India; it gives rise to a liability dehors the covenants. After the Constitution, the obligation to pay privy purse rested upon the Union of India not because it was inherited from the Dominion of India but because of the constitutional mandate under Art.
 291. The source of the obligation is in Art. 291 and not in the covenants and agreements. Reference to the covenants and agreements in the article is for defining the privy purse. The obligation which arose out of the merger agreement and was on that account an act of state stied its original character on acceptance by the Constitution. The Union of India cannot plead act of state as defence against claim by the Rulers to Privy Purse. [89 F; 90 B-D] Doss v. Secretary of State for India in Council, [187] L.R.

 892, held inapplicable.
 (vi) An obligation which arises out of a constitutional provision to pay to the citizens sums of money in recognition of obligations of the predecessor Government may scarcely be called imperfect. A perfect obligation pertains to the domain of law and justice and imperfect obligation to the domain of benevolence. [89 E] (vii) The courts have jurisdiction to interpret and to determine the true meaning of articles 366(22), 291, 36 2 and 363 and the bar to the jurisdiction of the courts by article 363 is a limited bar. Article 363 excludes the jurisdiction of the courts only in respect of the matter specified therein. A provision which purports to. exclude the jurisdiction of the courts in certain matters and to deprive the aggrieved party of the normal remedy will be strictly construed, for, it is a principle not to be whittled down that an aggrieved party will not, unless the jurisdiction of the Courts is by clear enactment or necessary implication bar-red, be denied recourse to the courts for determination of his rights. It is within the province of the Court alone to determine what the dispute brought before it is, and to determine whether the jurisdiction of the Court is, because it falls within one of the two limbs of article 363, excluded qua that dispute.
 Jurisdiction to try a proceeding is barred under the first limb of article 363 if the dispute "arises" out of the provision of a covenant; it is barred under the second limb of the article if the court holds that the dispute is with respect to a right arising out of a provision of the Constitution relating to a covenant. A dispute that an order of an executive body is unauthorised, or a legislative measure is ultra vires, is not one arising out of any covenant under the first limb of article 363, merely because the order or the measure violates the right of the citizen which, but for the act or measure, were not in question.
 The dispute in such a case relates to the validity of the Act or the vires of the measures. Exclusion of the Court's jurisdiction by the terms of the relevant words in the second limb of Art. 363 lies in a narrow field. The expression "provisions of this Constitution relating 16 to" means provisions having a dominant and immediate connection with; it does not mean merely having a reference to. If the constitutional provision relating to a covenant is the source of the right claimed to accrue, or liability claimed to arise, then clearly under the second limb the jurisdiction of the court to entertain a dispute with respect to the right or obligation is barred [94 H-95 D; 96 B-E, 99 F] (viii) It cannot be urged that the jurisdiction of the courts to enforce rights and obligations arising out of the covenants was excluded because the rights and obligations arose out of acts of State and by constitutional provision that exclusion was affirmed and extended after the Constitution. There can be no act of State against its own citizens by the State. The Rulers who were before integration of their States aliens qua the Dominion Government are now citizens. Their rights and obligations which arose from an act of State are now recognised and accepted by the Union of India. An act of state vanishes when the new sovereign recognises either expressly or by implication the rights flowing therefrom. Enforcement of those rights and obligations is governed by the municipal laws, and unless the jurisdiction of the Courts is excluded in respect of any dispute, the courts will be competent to grant relief.

 (ix) Article 366(22) is a provision relating to recognition of Rulers and that is the direct and only purpose of the provision. It is not a provision relating to a covenant and the reference to the covenant or the agreement of the nature mentioned in article 291 is only for determining who may be recognised as a Ruler. The limited exclusion of the, jurisdiction of courts in article 363 does not operate upon the claim for a privy purse relying upon article 291. [97 C- E; 98 E] Nawab Usman Ali Khan v. Sagarmal, [1965] INSC 50; [1965] 3 S.C.R, 201 and Kunvar Shri Vir Rajendra Singh v. Union of India and Others, [1970]S.C.R. 631 distinguished and explained.
 [The observations in Nawab Usman Ali Khan that the essential political character of the guarantee for the payment of privy purse preserved by article 363, and the obligation cannot be enforced in any municipal court held unnecessary for the purpose "of the decision in that case and incorrect.][98 D-E] (x) Reference to the covenant in article 291 merely identifies the sum payable as privy purse; it does not make the article a provision relating to the covenant. The source of the right to receive the privy purse is the constitutional mandate; it is not the covenant. A dispute as to the right to ,receive the privy, purse is therefore not a dispute arising out of the covenant within the first limb of article 363 nor is a dispute with regard to a right accruing or obligation arising out of the provisions of a constitution relating to a covenant. [99 B-C] (xi) Article 362 is plainly a provision relating to covenants within the meaning of article 363. A claim to enforce the rights, privileged and dignities under the covenants will therefore be barred by the first limb of article 363 and a claim to enforce the recognition of right and privileges recognised by article 362 will be barred under the second limb of article 363. Jurisdiction of the courts will however not by excluded where the relief claimed is founded on a statutory provision enacted to give effect to personal rights under article 362 [99 D] 17 (xii) Therefore, the Court will give effect to the constitutional mandate in art. 363 only if satisfied that the dispute arises out of any provision of a covenant which is in force and was entered into or executed before the commencement of the Constitution and to which "the predecessor of the Government of India was a party, or that it is in respect of rights, liabilities or obligations accruing or arising under any provision of the Constitution in relation to a covenant; but since he right to privy purse arises under article 291 the dispute in respect of which does not fall in either clause, the jurisdiction of the court is not excluded. Again, the jurisdiction of the Court is not excluded in respect of disputes relating to personal rights and privileges which are granted by statutes. [99 F- H] (xiii) Since the order of the President is without authority of law there is a clear infringement of the guarantee of the fundamental rights under articles 19(1) (f), 21 and 31 (1) of the Constitution. [72 H] The Court did not express any opinion (1) on the question whether a dispute that an executive act or legislative measure operating upon a right accruing or liability arising out of a provision is invalid, falls within the second limb of article 363 and (ii) on the plea that the order was made for a collateral purpose.
 On the view taken, the Court did not deal with the plea that Rulership was "property" and the Order of the President deprived the petitioners of that property without authority of law. [73 A] Per Hedge, J. (1) The meaning given to the expression `Ruler' in article 366(22) is only for the purpose of the Constitution and not for any other purpose. Rulers of Indian States disappeared as soon as their territories were merged with India and all those quondam Rulers became citizens of India. Their rulership is merely a status entitling them to Privy Purse and certain privileges.
 Articles 291, 362 and 366(2)(a) and (b) (before Its deletion), as well as entry 34 of List I of Schedule VII referred to Rulers and, therefore, it became necessary to define that expression. [160 E-G; 161 A] (ii) Article 366(22) imposes a constitutional duty on the President and for that purpose has conferred on him certain powers. The power is one coupled with duty. The President cannot create a successor; he can only recognise the successor. Recognition means the power to locate. Hence the power conferred on the President under the second part of article 366(22) is a very limited power. The power has to be exercised in accordance with law; in other words it has to be exercised as a quasi-judicial power. The expression "for the time being" in the second part of the article is relevant as the question of recognition of a new ruler arises on the death of each Ruler. The expression contemplates the continuity of Rulership so long as the Ruler who entered into covenant or agreement or a successor of his is in existence. [164 G, B-C] (iii) The power to recognise the Rulers does not include the power not to recognise. The President cannot do indirectly what the legislature cannot do directly. Ruler as referred to in some of the provisions of the Constitution is an entity created by the Constitution to further certain purposes recognised by the Constitution. That entity cannot be abolished either by the executive or by the legislature.
 Therefore, it is not possible to spell out a power to abolish the Rulership under Article 366(22). [165 G, H] 18 [His Lordships did not go into the question whether a Ruler once recognised can be derecognised by the President and, if so, under what circumstances.] (iv) The power of recognition of the Rulers cannot be claimed to be a facet of the paramountcy enjoyed by_the British Crown. Paramountcy is the very antithesis of rule of law and the government of India cannot consider itself a superior, power in its relationship with the citizens of this country. Nature and scope of the power exercisable by the President under a provision of the Constitution must be spelled out from the language of the provision and from the purpose intended to be served by the provision. [166 E-G] (v) The plea of State policy is irrelevant in the context of this case. If the Constitution has laid down a policy, that policy cannot be departed from either by the legislature or by the executive. Neither the legislature nor the executive, can have a policy which runs counter to the policy laid down by the Constitution. [159 E] (vi)The stand taken by the Union of India that the concept of Rulership, Privy Purse and the privileges guaranteed to the Rulers have become incompatible with "democracy equity and social justice" raise political issues. This Court is not the forum for going into political issues, nor is it concerned with political passions surrounding the issues arising for decision in this case. [159 B] (vii) Hidayatullah, C.J. concurring). There is nothing like a political power under our Constitution in the matter of relationship between the executive and the citizens. The Constitution recognises only three power viz:, the legislative, judicial and executive. The executive cannot exercise any sovereignty over its citizens. The legal sovereignty vests with the Constitution and the political sovereignty with the people. The President is a creature of the Constitution; he can only act in accordance with the Constitution.

 (viii) The President on the advice of the Cabinet has disregarded the mandate of arts. 53(1), 73(1), 291, 362 and 366(22). That being so, his order must be held to be ultra vires the Constitution; hence a nullity. [168 B] (ix)The impugned order is also unconstitutional for the reason that the power conferred under art. 366(22) is exercised for a collateral purpose. The circumstances under which the impugned order came to be made show that there was attempt to do indirectly what the government could not do directly. Such an exercise of power is impermissible under article 366(22). If the Constitution or any of its provisions have ceased to serve the needs of the people, ways must be found to change them but it is impermissible to bypass the Constitution or its provisions. For that reason also the impugned orders must be held to be ultra vires art.

 19 the Constitution recognised the rights accruing and liabilities and obligations arising under various agreements and covenants which recognition made those right, liabilities and obligations enforceable. But without article 363 article 362 would have opened the flood gate of litigation. The Constituent Assembly evidently wanted to avoid that situation. That appears to have been the main reason for enacting article 363. [185 F-G & 186 A-C] Rajendra Singh's case, State of Seraikella v. Union of India and Anr. etc.[1951] INSC 23; , [1951] S.C.R. 474, Visweshwar Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh, [1962] S.C.R. 1020, Sri Sudhansu Shekhar Singh Deo v.

 (xi)Article 363 excludes the jurisdiction of courts only in respect of matters coming under article 362. The contention that article 363 excludes also the right arising from article 291 because article 291 also protects personal rights falling within the scope of article 362, has no force. Privy Purse was taken out for special treatment by the Constitution under article 291 and therefore it is excluded from the general provision in article 362.
 Further, there was no purpose in guaranteeing the payment ofPrivy Purse under article 291 and then taking away the right to recoverthem under article 363. In the case of most of the Rulers the right toreceive Privy Purse was an enforceable right even before article 291 came into force. It is not easy to accept the contention that what was an enforceable right was made unenforceable by the Constitution. [184 H-185 D] (xii)The liability undertaken under article 291 is a new liability and not an affirmation of an existing liability arising under the covenants and agreements. The article is in no way linked with covenants and agreements. The covenants and agreements only continue as evidence as to matters mentioned in the first part of article 291. After article 291 came into force there is no legal relationship between the covenants and agreements and that article. The article read with Art. 366(22) constitute a sell contained code in the matter of payment of Privy Purses and those articles operate on their own force. [177 D, E] (xiii)It is not possible to accept the contention that the expression "charged on...... the Consolidated Fund of India" in article 291 merely means that the amounts payable as Privy Purse are not notable and that the expression neither creates a right in favour of the person in whose benefit the charge is created nor is the Consolidated Fund pledged for the payment of the Privy Purse. If an item of expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund merely means that the expenditure is non-votable then there was no need to provide in article 113 that "so much of the estimate as relates to expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India shall not be submitted to the vote of Parliament". That part of article 113 was evidently enacted to make effective the statutory lien over the Consolidated Fund created in favour of the person to, 20 whom the payment had to be made. It emphasises the fact that the pledge created in favour of the person for whose benefit the charge is created by the Constitution, cannot be taken away even by the Parliament. No sooner the President recognises the Ruler of an Indian State, he becomes entitled to the Privy Purse guaranteed under article 291 from the date the Constitution came into force. Every constitutional sanction for payment is necessarily a mandate to pay if that sanction relates to the discharge of an obligation; it is an enforceable mandate. Besidesthe executive cannot take the stand that it will not respect a mandate of the Constitution unless that mandate is enforceable in a court of law.
 Whether a particular constitutional mandate is enforceable or not, itis all the same binding on all the organs of the State. [177 E-H;182 C-D] (xiv)A dispute whether the President has the power to abolish all Rulers under article 366(22) quite plainly cannot be held to be a dispute in respect of "any right accruing under or any liability or obligation arising out of any of the provisions of the Constitution relating to any such treaty, agreement, covenant........ within the meaning at the second part of article 363. What is in dispute is the true scope of the power of the President under article 366(22). Power is an authority whereas a right in the context in which it is used in article 363 signifies property. A dispute as regards the interpretation of a provision of the Constitution is not a dispute within the contemplation of the second limb of article 363 as it is not a dispute in 'respect of any right, liability or obligation.
 The word "relating to" is a word of wide import but in the context in which it is used in article 363, it must have a narrower, meaning. The word means "to bring into relation", or "establish relation between". In other words, the provision of the Constitution in question must be linked with the merged agreements or covenants directly and immediately. It must have no independent existence.
 Article 366(22) is an independent provision. It has nothing to do with the agreements and covenants. [186 G-187 G] (xv)Article 362 clearly links itself with the agreements and covenants and it has no independent existence apart from the agreements and covenants; [182 G] [His Lordship did not find it necessary to go into the scope of article 362.] (xvi)The petitioners have established that their rights under articles 31 and 19(1)(f) have been contravened. The right to receive the Privy Purse under article 291, being a legal right, is a right enforceable through the courts of law. That right is undoubtedly property. The denial of those benefits which had been afforded the Rulers under statutes is again a contravention of the petitioners' fundamental right to property. [194 E, G] State of M.P. v.

 (Per Mitter. J. dissenting). The Order of the President though unjustified, is not liable to be challenged, because, article 363 is a bar to the maintainability of the petitions. [152 G-H] (1)Article 366(22) implies not merely a right or power but a duty or obligation to recognise a person as a Ruler both at the commencement of the Constitution and even afterwards so long as the line of 21 Rulers lasted and the choice of a person as a Ruler to succeed another has to be made applying the law and custom attaching to the gaddi of a particular state. Unless a Ruler can be identified for the purpose of the Constitution articles 291, 362 and 363 cannot be applied. Clause (22) fixes the identity of the Ruler for the purposes of the Constitution as a prince, chief or other person by whom any covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause (1) of article 291 was entered. into. The power or duty to withdraw recognition must be confined to cases when the first recognition was not proper.
 Maharaja Pravir Chandra Bhanj Deo Kakatiya v. The State of Madhya Pradesh, [1960] INSC 205; [1961] 2 S.C.R. 501 held inapplicable.
 (ii)The power of recognition is- not a political power in the paramountcy field. In strict legal theory whatever paramountcy there was before the 15th August 1947 in the British Government lapsed with the passing of the Indian Independence Act. Paramountcy de facto there undoubtedly was but no legal sanction can be ascribed to such paramountcy.

 (iii) Once the Rulers ceded their territories and accepted the Constitution ofIndia they became citizens of India and the plea of continuance of an actof state as against them cannot be accepted.
 (iv) The recognition of Rulership is not an exercise of political power vested in the President:
 Kunwar Shri Vir Rajendra Singh v. Union of India, [1970] 2 S.C.R. 63 1, explained.
 (v)Article 291 is meant to put the guarantee as to payment of Privy Purse contained in the Covenants and agreements on a firm and sure footing. It is not a mere declaration of pious intention which the executive could disregard at its whim or pleasure; so long as it finds a place in the Constitution it is to be acted upon.
 (vi)Article 363 imposes an absolute bar on the jurisdiction of all courts to adjudicate upon disputes covered by it.
 The object of the article was as much to save the Rulers who had entered into covenants or agreements etc. from their rivals or kinsmen coming to court to upset the covenants or agreements as to shield the Government of India from attempts on the part of Rulers to rip open the covenants.
 To see whether any dispute falls within the second limb of the article one must examine the content of the right or the limit of the liability or obligation arising out of any constitutional provision which. provision in its turn must relate to any treaty, agreement etc. The expression relate to" means, inter alia, "stand in some relation, to have bearing or concern, to pertain, to refer to, bring into association with or connection with".

 Karnani Industrial Bank Ltd., 58 I.A. 215, referred to.
 (vii)Article 291 is a provision of the Constitution relating to covenants or merger agreements. It is not a provision merely for finding out the amount of the liability of the Dominion of India by way of privy purse to a Ruler. It expressly refers to covenants or agreements entered into by the Rulers under which payment of sums free of tax has been guaranteed or assured by the government of the Dominion of India as Privy Purse and gives the term as to Privy Purse a new shape and form. The article seeks to instill life and vigour into the term for payment of Privy Purse in the covenant by creating a new channel leading out of the guarantee of the government of the Dominion of India which was no longer in existence and making it flow along a constitutional course by putting the liability of the Union of India for payment of the sums beyond controversy. So considered any dispute as to payment of privy purse would come under the bar of article 363. [136 G; 140 D; 14t D; 142 D; 143 C] Kunwar Shri Vir Rajendra Singh v. Union of India, [1969] INSC 265; [1970] 2 S.C.R. 631, referred to.
 (viii) Since the President's power or right or duty or obligation to recognise a person as a Ruler arises not merely out of the provisions in article 366(22) but also the covenants, merger agreements or instruments of accession the dispute is one which arises out a provision of the Constitution relating to a treaty, agreement, covenant etc.
 in terms of article 363. [151 D-E] (ix)It cannot be urged that if the act complained of is ultra vires or a nullity the jurisdiction of the courts would not be excluded. constitutional provision of the kind of article 363 transcends this kind of consideration. All that the Court has to see is whether the dispute falls within either limb of the article. If the dispute is so covered the court is precluded from examining whether the contention of the party asserting a right was genuine or of real substance. Equally, the bar will apply where a party denying the right asserted or contesting the claim put forward is guilty of action which on the face of things appears to be arbitrary if there be some scope for raising the plea in denial or contradiction.

 (x)Notwithstanding the wide sweep of the provision for ousting the jurisdiction of courts as regards disputes covered by it, article 363 gave ,express power to the President to have the opinion of this Court to guide himself by, and when disputes of such public importance were agitating the minds of members of Parliament and of the Cabinet it was not only his right but his duty to consult this Court. [152 A] Per Ray, J. (dissenting), that the petitions fail and are dismissed.
 (1) Articie 363 embodies the principles of Acts of state.
 The entire relationship of the Dominion of India vis-a-vis the Indian states was in the domain of Act of State and the instruments, merger agreements and covenants did not have any constitutional sanction and obligation and were totally unenforceable in municipal courts. This Court has in several decisions so held. Article 363 and the other allied articles really reflect what the makers of the Constitution picked up from the historical past and inserted in the Constitution. [206 G, 207 H] State of Seraikella v.

 (ii)The power of recognition of Rulership is political, because, it is exercised by the President in relation to prince or chief by whom any covenant or merger agreement was entered into and the necessity for recognition arises from the covenants and merger agreements. It is political also because it is not limited only to the law of succession or custom. The reasons of state policy will enter the field.
 it is not a compulsive power. The considerations which moves the President are matters on which the Court will find no standard for resolving it judicially. [210 F] (iii)The rights accruing under or obligations arising out of the provisions of the Constitution relating to covenants or merger agreements are imperfect rights. There are no legal rights as to recognition of rulership, payment of Privy Purse and enjoyment of rights and privileges. [208 G] (iv)Recognition of a Ruler under article 366(22) is only for the limited purpose of payment of privy purse and it has no other reference. There cannot be any legal right to recognition because, the Power of the president to recognise for the time being repels any concept of legal right to Rulership Since the obligation to recognise a Ruler arises only from the covenants and agreements and there cannot be any legal enforceable right to recognition under the covenant, no legal right to arises under article 366(22) either. This is political power ship` power belonging to the State, its government and policy and there is no judicial process to adjudicate upon such considerations. It is sophistry to speak of Rulership as an institution. When institutions are recognised the Constitution has specifically designated and recognied them. The President has power to derecognise. The Constitution does not say that the President is bound to recognise a Ruler. It follows therefore that after derecognition he is not equally bound to recognise another person as Ruler.

 (v) Article 363 is a non obstante clause and it is a constitutional mandate. The non obstante clause must be allowed to operate with full vigour in its own field. [211 A; 212 A] N.P. Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer, Namakkal Constituency & Ors. [1952] INSC 2; [1952] S.C.R. 218, Aswini Kumar Ghosh and Anr. v. Arabind Bose and Anr. [1953] S.C.R. I and Dominion of India and Anr. v. Shrinbai A.Irani, [1955] I S.C.R. 206, referred to.
 (vi)Article 363 is a positive rule of unenforceability of certain rights and obligations. This Court has held that the article is a bar in any dispute relating to covenants and merger agreements, that the privy purse is a political pension and that the article constitutes a bar to interference by court in a dispute arising by reason of recognition of Rulership.

 631, referred to.
 (vii)The dispute as to jurisdiction of the President is not in vacuo but is adispute as to right of recognition of Ruler for the purpose of paymentof Privy Purse and enjoyment of rights and privileges. The disputeis whether the President has or has not the power to make the order impugned in these proceedings. [213 B] United Provinces v. Governor-General in Council, [1949] F.C.R. 124 referred to.
 (viii)Article 366(22) relates to covenants or agreements.
 No person can be recognised as a Ruler until first be entered into a covenant referred to in article 291, or secondly, he is recognised by the President as the successor of the Ruler recognised under the first part of clause (22).
 Therefore, the claim to be recognised as a Ruler can only arise if he or his predecessor signed the covenant and thus there is express and direct relation to covenants. Article 366(22) has been put in relation to article 291 and article 362 and one cannot abstract article 366(22) from the collection of those articles. All these three articles viz., 291 362 and 366(22) stem from the covenants and merger agreements. Ruler in article 366(22) is description of the person referred to in article 291 and 362. If the petitioner challenges the power of the President to derecog- nise him he claims that he has a right to continue as a Ruler and this is a right related to covenants. [216 E-G, B- D] (ix) The proposition that if the order is a nullity there is no bar of jurisdiction, is inapplicable to the present case where the question for consideration is of the Constitution which under some articles confers jurisdiction on this Court and in another article excludes the jurisdiction of the Court. A private clause of this nature in the Constitution stands on an entirely different footing from a clause of that nature in other statutes. The fallacy of the petitioners' submission that because the order of the President is a nullity the petitioners' property rights are invaded and hence the jurisdiction of this Court is attracted, is, in totally overlooking the provisions of article 363 which excludes in express and unambiguous terms the jurisdiction of this Court "notwithstanding" any provision of the Constitution. When the Constitution which invests this 25 Court with jurisdiction with one hand divests it of jurisdiction with another in specifically designed disputes the attempt to overreach the article which bars the jurisdiction of the Court will be totally impermeable.

Douds, [1950] USSC 56; 339 U.S. 382, referred to.
 (x)Article 291, being a constitutional recognition of the guarantee regarding Privy Purse mentioned in covenants and agreements, does not create any new and independent right of payment of Privy Purse; therefore the article is related to covenants. It embodies the constitutional recognition for the fulfillment of the guarantees and assurances given by the Government of India in respect of Privy Purses and provides for necessary adjustments in respect of Privy Purse entailed by changed circumstances and conditions. A Ruler of an Indian State without being recognised a Ruler by the President, cannot prefer any claim to Privy Purse under article 291. The Ruler of an Indian State mentioned in the first Part of article 291 is different from Ruler mentioned in 291(b). The latter refers to the Ruler defined under article 366(22) and recognised by the President. It is because of the combined effect of articles 291, 366(22) and 363 that this Court held in Nawab Usman Ali Khan's case the privy purse was paid on political consideration that it was not a right legally enforceable in any municipal court and that the political character was preserved by article .363 by taking privy purse beyond the reach of courts of law.
 [221 B, B; 222 E-H] Nawab Usman Ali Khan v. Sagarmal, [1965] INSC 50; [1965] 3 S.C.R. 201 relied on.

 (xi)Because the payment of privy purses was to be free of all taxes under the covenants and agreements whereas under the Constitution it is exempt from all taxes on income, article 291 cannot be said to create a new right. The words "the sums so paid" in cl. (b) of the article relate to the sum guaranteed under the covenants and agreements and to the same sum charged on the Consolidated Fund. One has to turn to, the covenants and merger agreement to have all the particulars of persons, sums guaranteed and assured. The fons et origo is the guarantee in the covenants and agreements. [227 F] (xii) The words "charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund" in article 291 do not mean that a security is created in respect of privy purse and therefore a new and independent right is created. Under the article effect is to be given to the covenants and merger agreements where payment of any sum has been guaranteed. The charge is only in respect of the right and obligation under the covenant an it is therefore neither a new nor an independent right. [223 D] (xiii)The words "charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund" mean that the sums shall not be submitted to the vote of Parliament and article 113(1) makes a provision to that effect. If it were a charge it 26 would be a debt which would be; assignable and there cannot be any legal validity for such assignment. Charge on the Consolidated Fund is an .accounting arrangement before Parliament and charge is meant for expenditure. The words "paid out of the Consolidated Fund" denote the source from which the expenditure would be met. The right to payment ,arises de-hors the charge on the Consolidated Fund, the right arises from recognition by article 291 of guarantee of payment of privy purses under a covenant. [224 D; 225 G-H] (xiv) Therefore, article 362 is not the only article which falls within article 363. Article 363 uses the word provisions of the Constitution. The word provisions indicate more than one article. It has to be emphasised that article 291, 363 and 366(22) have a most direct and visible relation to article 363. [228 B-C] (xv)"Rights, liabilities and obligations" in articles 294(b) and 295(1)(b) of the Constitution refer to other legal rights which were enforceable in a court of law.
 Privy purses under the covenants and merger agreements were no such legal rights enforceable in a court of law for the obvious reason that if prior to the Constitution the covenants and merger agreements were sought to be enforced in a municipal court, the government would have demurred on the plea of Act of State. That plea in bar would be available to the Government of India as a defence to any claim under articles 294(b) and 295(1)(b). Articles 294(b) and 295(1)(b) deal with devolution of liabilities of the dominion and part B States respectively. The Constitution has dealt with privy purses and covenants in separate articles. Therefore,_articles 294(b) and 295(1)(b) can have no application to privy purses and privileges. [229 E- F] Union of India and Ors. v. Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing (Weaving) Co. Ltd. and Anr., [1964] INSC 141; [1964] 7 S.C.R. 892 and The South India Corporation (P) Ltd. v. The Secretary, Board of Revenue, Trivandram ,and Anr., [1963] INSC 163; [1964] 4 S.C.R. 280, referred to.
 (xvi) In sum, the agreement to pay privy purses and to continue privileges of the Princes which were guaranteed by the Government of India before the Constitution were all political agreements born out of political bargains to achieve integration of Indian States with the Dominion of India. This political bargain was carried into the Constitution by the insertion of article 291 for payment of privy purse, article 362 for continuance of privileges and article 366(22) for recognition of Princes, and the political character was preserved by inserting article 363 which bar the jurisdiction of the court in respect of disputes arising out of covenants and agreements and these articles which are related to the covenants and agreements.
 [229 G] (xvii) The petitioners cannot claim that the Order affects their rights under the various statutes. If the rights are derived from recognition of rulership by the President under article 366(22) and if the recognition ,cannot be impeached no right arises. [230 E] (xviii) Recognition of rulership is not a legal right nor is it a right to property. Privy purses is not a legal right to property and there is no fundamental right to privy purses. There is no fundamental right to rulership. The decisions of this Court which have held that article 363 is a bar to rights to privy purse, personal rights and privileges and recognition of rulership from being agitated in courts, have spoken the words of the Constitution.
