 One Mohanlal Fakirchand Khetan was the owner of a piece of land measuring 3.98.60 hectares bearing Survey No. 28 at village Bhushi in Maval Taluka of Pune District having purchased it under the sale deed dated January 18, 1966. The said land is, however, situated within the municipal limits of Lonavala town. Mohanlal Fakirchand Khetan died on May 18, 1976 leaving behind him his widow, respondent No. 1, and children respondents Nos. 2 to 5, as his heirs. In order to provide housing accommodation to economically weaker sections and to persons belonging to low income group and middle income group residing within Lonavala municipal limits and at the request of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority, a notice was published by the State Government under the proviso to section 41(1) of the Maharashtra Housing and Development Act, 1976 in Government Gazette dated August 30, 1979 inviting objections to the proposed acquisition of lands including the land which originally belonged to Mohanlal Fakirchand Khetan. Pursuant to the said notice Chandrakant Mohanlal Khetan, respondent No. 3 herein lodged his protest on September 6, 1979. After considering the various objections received from different people including the objections filed by Chandrakant Mohanlal Khetan on behalf of himself and the other co- owners, the State Government published the notification under sub-section (1) of section 41 in its Gazette dated July 3, 1980. On the publication of the said notificction the land of Mohanlal Fakirchand Khetan vested in the State Government free from all encumbrances. On December 12, 1980 a notice was 708 issued under section 42(1) of the Act, to the holders of the lands to surrender and deliver possession of their lands to the Collector, Pune within a period of 30 days. In January 1981, the legal representatives of Mohanlal Fakirchand Khetan objected to the notice on the ground that Survey No.
 28 of village Bhushi that is, the land belonging to them had not actually been notified in the notification published in the Gazette as it had been shown as lying in village Maval and not in village Bhushi. On discovering the error which had crept into the notification, on May 15, 1981 the State Government published a corrigendum making the requisite correction and thereafter issued a fresh notice on September 15, 1981 to the heirs of Mohanlal Fakirchand Khetan to deliver possession of the land bearing Survey No. 28 of village Bhushi situated within the Municipal limits of Lonavala. The widow and children of Mohanlal Fakirchand Khetan, respondents herein filed a writ petition in the High Court of Bombay questioning the validity of proceedings leading up to the issue of notification under section 41(1) of the Act and also the notification. The High Court negatived all the contentions raised by the respondents in the writ petition except the constitutionality of sub- section (3) and (4) of section 44 of the Act. It found that sub-section 3 and sub-section 4 of section 44 of the Act were unreasonable and discriminatory and therefore ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution. It found that the said provisions were not protected by Article 31C of the Constitution and further held that the impugned provisions of the legislation were otherwise unfair, unjust and unreasonable. The High Court also found that the deprivation of the property under sections 41 and 42 of the Act had not been done by authority of law. The High Court accordingly allowed the writ petition. Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court the State of Maharashtra and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority have filed this appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. Sub-sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Housing and Development Act, 1976 are constitutionally valid. [730 F-G] 
 2.1 Every Act carries with it the presumption of constitutionality and unless a party aggrieved in a writ petition is able to discharge the said burden by placing adequate 709 material, the Court should not strike down a legislative provision particularly by the application of Article 14.
 [726 A-C] In the instant case, sub-sections 3 and 4 of section 44 of the Act cannot be said to be discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, merely because in the case of lands in municipal area all the methods of valuation under the Land Acquisition Act, are not made available. [726 B-C] 
 2.2 The Act is not introduced for the benefit of areas like Bombay Corporation area and areas under the jurisdiction of other corporations and municipalities only.
 It is enacted for the whole State more than 90 per cent of which constitutes rural area. The potentialities of a land in a municiple area are far higher than the potentialities of land in a rural area. There is also no occasion under the Act for the State Government to treat one piece of land in a municipal area in one way and another piece of land in that area differently. All lands in a municipal area have to be valued in only one way that is in accordance with section 44(3) and (4) of the Act and all lands in rural areas have also to be valued only in one way and that is in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. There could have been two different Acts one for municipal areas and another for rural areas, each providing for a different method of valuation of land. Such a classification would have been un-exceptionable having regard to the object and purposes of the two Acts and the difference in the potentialities of the two types of lands. The method of capitalization is also one of the recognised methods which is adopted for the purpose of valuation of properties acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. All methods of valuation adopted under that Act are intended to achieve the same purpose, namely, determination of the market value of the land acquired. It is difficult to say whether any of them is superior to the other in the context of Article 14 of the Constitution and to hold that there will be discrimination, if any of them is not allowed to be availed of for purposes of valuation.

 2.3 Even granting for purposes of argument that subsections 3 & 4 of section 44 are violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, the said provisions receive the protection of Article 31C of the Constitution. [726 C-D] 
 3.1 Article 31C does not say that an Act there should be a declaration by the appropriate legislature to the effect that it is being enacted to achieve the object contained in Article 39(b). In order to ascertain whether it is protected by Article 31C, the Court has to satisfy itself about the character of the legislation by studying all parts of it. The question whether an Act is intended to secure the objects contained in Article 39(b) or not does not depend upon the declaration by the legislature but depends on its contents. [727 B-D] 
 3.2 The Maharashtra Housing and Development Act, 1976 makes provision for acquisition of private lands for providing sites for building houses or housing accommodation to the community. The title to the lands of the private holders which are acquired first vests in the State Government. Later on the land is developed and then distributed amongst the people as house sites. It also provides for reserving land for providing public amenities without which people cannot live there. Community centres, shopping complex, parks, roads, drains, play grounds, are all necessary for civic life and these amenities are enjoyed by all. That is also a kind of distribution within the meaning of Article 39(b) of the Constitution. The Act is brought into force to implement the directive principle contained in Article 39(b) and hence even if there is any infraction of Article 14 it is cured by Article 31C which is clearly attracted to the case.

 4. The Maharashtra Housing and Development Act, 1976 does not infringe Article 300A of the Constitution. Article 300A was not in force when the Act was enacted. Article 31 (1) of the Constitution which was couched in the same language was however in force. Article 31C gave protection to the Act even if it infringed Article 31. In this case, sub-section 3 and 4 of section 44 of the Act cannot be struck down on the ground that they are neither just nor fair or reasonable. Nothing contrary has been done by the authorities. Certain vacant lands lying inside a municipal area are being acquired for providing housing accommodation after paying an amount which is computed in accordance with a method considered to be a fair one by Courts. The purpose for which the lands are acquired is a public purpose. The owners are given opportunity to make their representations before the notification is issued. All the requirements of a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain even in the sense in which it is understood in the United States of America where property rights are given greater protection than what is required to be done in our country are fulfilled by the Act. [729 B-F] 
 5. Land ceiling laws, laws providing for acquisition of land for providing housing accommodation, laws imposing ceiling on urban property etc. cannot be struck down by invoking Article 21 of the Constitution. Article 21 essentially deals with personal liberty. It has little to do with the right to own property as such. This is not a case where the deprivation of property would lead to deprivation of life or liberty or livelihood. On the other hand land is being acquired to improve the living conditions of a larger number of people. To rely upon Article 21 of the Constitution for striking down the provisions of the Act amounts to a clear misapplication of the great doctrine enshrined in Article 21. [730 A-C] 
 6. Some problems presenting difficulty of valuation in the application of clause 5 of First Schedule to section 44(1) of the Act in regard to valuation of open lands situated in a city like Bombay or lands with building potentialities situated within the limits of big towns, are easily surmountable 712 problems of valuation in relation to individual lands and do not reflect on the constitutionality of the impugned provision. The concerned authorities entrusted with the function of making evaluation will doubtless resolve such problems as are likely to arise appropriately in accordance with law.
