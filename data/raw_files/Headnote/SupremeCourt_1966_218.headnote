 The appellant who was the owner of two shops rented to the respondent, filed a suit for the latter's ejection under Section 3 (1) (c) of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act III of 1947 which provides that no suit under the Act can be filed without the permission of the District Magistrate, except on the ground, inter alia, that the tenant has, without the permission of the landlord permitted or made such constructions as " materially altered the accommodation or is likely substantially to diminish its value". The appellant claimed that the respondent had carried out material alterations consisting of lowering of the floor level of the shop by about 1-1/2 ft. by excavating earth and putting up a new floor, of lowering correspondingly the front door which entailed cutting and removal of the plinthband on which the door rested, of lowering likewise the level of the staircase in the shop and putting up new steps, and lowering the height of the Chabutra outside the shop so as to correspond it to the level of the new ground floor of the shop.
 The trial Judge as well as the First Additional Civil Judge, in appeal, concurrently found that the respondent had carried out material alterations within the -meaning of s. 3 (1) (c); the appellant was therefore entitled to file a suit without obtaining the permission -of the District Magistrate and to a decree of eviction. In the appeal before the High Court it was contended on behalf of the respondent that on a proper interpretation of Clause (c) of Section 3(1), the appellant had also to establish-that the alterations, be- sides being material alterations, were likely substantially to diminish the value of the accommodation. In other words, the word "or" in Clause (c) should be read as "and". The High Court accepted this contention and held that as there was no finding by the lower court that any harm or damage had been caused to the building the appellant was not entitled to relief under s. 3 (1) (c).
 
HELD : Allowing the appeal : Even if the alterations did not cause any damage to the premises or did not substantially diminish their value, the alterations were material alterations and on that basis alone the appellants were entitled to evict the respondent. [841 H] The language of the clause makes it clear that the legislature wanted to lay down two alternatives which would furnish a ground to the landlord to sue without the District Magistrate's permission, that is, where the tenant has made such construction which would materially alter the accommodation or which would be likely to substantially diminish its value.

 837 Although no general definition can be given of what "material alterations" mean, as such a question would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, the alterations in the present case amounted to 'material alterations" as the construction carried out by the respondent bad affect of altering the form and structure of the accommodation.
