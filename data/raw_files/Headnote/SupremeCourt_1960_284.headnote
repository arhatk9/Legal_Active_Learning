 By Art. 20(2) of the Constitution "No person shall be prose- cuted and punished for the same offence more than once." Section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, provides, "Where an act or omission constitutes an offence under two or more enactments, then the offender shall be liable to be prosecuted and punished under either or any of those enactments, but shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence." The respondents were both convicted and sentenced by the Magistrate under s. 409 Of the Indian Penal Code and S. 105 Of the Insurance Act. The Sessions judge on appeal upheld the conviction and sentence under S. 409 of the Indian Penal Code, but set aside the conviction and sentence under s. 105 of the Insurance Act on the ground that no sanction under s.
 107 of the Insurance Act had been obtained. Sanction was thereafter obtained and a fresh complaint was filed against the respondents under s. 105 of the Insurance Act. The trial ended in an acquittal by the Magistrate who held that Art. 20(2) Of the Constitution and also s. 26 of the General Clauses Act were a bar to conviction. The State appealed to the High Court against the 108 order of acquittal but the appeal was dismissed. On further appeal by the State, Held, that the crucial requirement to attract Art. 202) Of the Constitution is that the two offences should be identical. it is, therefore, necessary to analyse and compare the ingredients of the two offences, and not the allegations made in the two complaints, to see whether their identity is established.
 So judged, there can be no doubt that in spite of the presence of certain common elements between the two, the offences under S. 409 of the Indian Penal Code and S., 105 of the Insurance Act are distinct in their ingredients, content and scope and cannot be said to be identical.
 Om Prakash Gupta v. State of U. P., [1957] INSC 2; [1957] S.C.R. 423 and State of Madhya Pradesh v. Veereshw ar Rao Agnihotry[1957] INSC 30; , [1957] S.C.R. 868, referred to.
 A similar view of the scope of the rule as to double- jeopardy has always been taken by the American Courts.
 Albrecht v. United States, [1927] USSC 1; (1927) 273 U. S. 1: 71 Law Ed.
 505, referred to.
 In S. 26 of the General Clauses Act also the emphasis is not on the facts alleged in the two complaints but on the ingredients of the two offences charged.
 This construction of Art. 20(2) of the Constitution and S.
 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, is precisely in line with s. 403(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 Consequently, it could not be said, in the instant case, that the respondents were being sought to be punished for the same offence so as to attract either Art. 20(2) Of the Constitution or S. 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.
