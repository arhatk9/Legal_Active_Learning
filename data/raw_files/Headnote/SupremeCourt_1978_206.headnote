 The appellant assessee, a public limited company carrying on business in manufacture and sale of yarn, set up a new industrial undertaking during the financial year ending 31st March, 1959 being the accounting year relevant to the assessment year 1959-60. The entire amount of depreciation and development rebate in respect of this new unit for the assessment years 1959-60 and 1960-61 were set off against the total profit of the assessee arising out of all units old and new, and therefore nothing remained unabsorbed to be carried forward to the next assessment year 1961-62. In the assessment year 1961-62 the assessee earned a net business income of Rs. 12,69,403/- which included a sum of Rs. 1,36,822/- representing the income from the new unit. The assessee in its assessment to tax for this assessment year claimed exemption of the income from the new unit to the extent of 6% of the average capital employed in it under section 15C of the Income Tax Act 1922. Taking the view that the benefit of Sec. 15(c) sub-section (1) could be claimed by the assessee only if there was any profit derived from the new unit and since the profit was, by reason of sub-section (3) of Sec. 15C required to be computed in accordance with the trading result of the new unit without reference to any other activity carried on by the assessee and if that was done, the result would clearly show that there was a loss in the working of the new unit in the assessment year 1961-62, the Income Tax Officer held that the benefit of exemption under Sec. 15C, sub-section (1) was not available to the assessee and thus the claim of the assessee for exemption was rejected. In appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner set aside the order of the Income Tax Officer but on further appeal by the Revenue to the Tribunal the order of the Income Tax Officer was restored. The same view was taken by the Tribunal in regard to the assessment in the year 1962-63. The High Court, on a reference, agreed with the view taken by the Tribunal. Hence the appeals by special leave in respect of the assessment years 1961-62 and 1962-63.
 Allowing the appeals, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: (1) The law of income tax in a modern society is intended to achieve various social and economic objectives and is used as an instrument for accelerating economic growth and development. Sec. 15C is a provision introduced in the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 with a view to carrying out this objective and it is calculated to encourage setting up of new industrial undertakings. [1147 A-B] Sub-section (1) of Sec. 15C exempts from tax so much of the profits or gains derived from a new industrial undertaking as do not exceed 6% per annum of the capital employed in the undertaking and, therefore, there must 1139 be profits or gains derived from the new industrial undertaking in the assessment year in question before any claim for exemption can be sustained under Sec. 15C, sub- sec. (1). If there are no profits or gains derived from the new industrial undertaking in any particular assessment year, there can be no question of any exemption, because it is only where there are such profits or gains that to the extent of 6% per annum of the capital employed, they become eligible for exemption [1147 B, C-D] (2) Though the profits of each distinct business carried on by an assessee have to be computed separately, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 10, the tax is chargeable under that section not separately on the profits of each business, but on the aggregate of the profits of all the business carried on by the assessee. Therefore, where the assessee carries on several he is entitled under section 10 to set off loss in one business against profits of another. If there is any loss in a business carried on by the assessee by reason of the profits of such business not being sufficient to absorb the depreciation allowance, such loss can be set off against the profits of another business carried on by the assessee. If, however there are no profits chargeable under the head 'Business or profession' or if the profits chargeable under that head are insufficient to cover the depreciation allowance, the amount of the allowance to the extent to which it is not absolved can be set off against profits chargeable under any other head for the assessment year. This is the plain and undoubted effect of Section 24 sub-section (1). [1148 A-E] Anglo-French Textile Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, 23 ITR 82 at 86; Commissioner of Income Tax v. Indo- Mercantile Bank Ltd., 36 ITR 1 at 6; at 6; Commissioner of Income Tax v. Muthuraman Chettiar 44 ITR 710 at 713 referred to.
 (3) It is clear on a plain reading of the language of proviso (b) to clause (vi) of Section 10 of the Act, that it comes into operation only where full effect cannot be given to the depreciation allowance for the assessment year in question owing to there being no profits or gains chargeable for that year or profits or gains chargeable being less than the depreciation allowance. [1149 B-C] (4) The words 'no profits or gains chargeable for that year' are not confined to profits and gains derived from the business whose income is being computed under section 10, but they refer to the totality of the profits or gains computed under the various heads and chargeable to tax. It is, therefore, clear that effect must be given to depreciation allowance first against the profits or gains of the particular business whose income is being computed under section 10 and if the profits of that business are not sufficient to absorb the depreciation allowance, the allowance to the extent to which it is not absorbed would be set off against the profits of any other business and if a part of the depreciation allowance still remains unabsorbed, it would be liable to be set off against the profits or gains chargeable under any other head and it its only if some part of the depreciation allowance still remains unabsorbed that it can be carried forward to the next assessment year. Obviously, therefore, there would be no scope for the applicability of proviso (b) to clause (vi) if the total income of the assessee chargeable to tax is sufficient to absorb the depreciation allowance, for then there would not be any unabsorbed depreciation allowance to be carried forward to the following assessment year. But where any part of 1140 the depreciation allowance remains unabsorbed after being set off against the total income chargeable to tax, it can be carried forward under proviso (b) to clause (vi) to the following year and set off against that year's income and so on for succeeding years. The method adopted by the statute for achieving this result is that the carried forward depreciation allowance is deemed to be part of and stands on exactly the same footing as, the current depreciation for the assessment year and is this allowable as a deduction under clause (vi). Therefore, when the profits or gains of a business for a particular assessment year are to be computed under Sec. 10, the current depreciation allowance for the assessment year in question is deductible under clause (vi) but the depreciation allowance of the preceding years would be liable to be taken into account only if, and to the extent to which, it is not absorbed by the total income of the assessee computed under different heads and chargeable to tax for those assessment years. [1149 D-H, 1150 A-B] Commissioner of Income Tax v. Jaipuria China Clay Mines, 59 ITR 555 followed.
 (5) Though the amount of the development rebate is, under the main provisions in sub-clause (ii) of clause (vi- b), allowable in the first instance against the profits or gains of the particular business whose profits or gains are being computed, clause (i) of Explanation (1) makes it clear that if any part of the development rebate remains unabsorbed, it is to be set off against the other income of the assessee under any of the chargeable heads and it is only if some part of the development rebate still remains outstanding that it can be carried forward to the following assessment year and set off against the total income of the assessee for that year. The amount of the development rebate is to be set off against the total income of the assessee and not merely against the profits or gains of the particular business in respect of which the development rebate is granted and so also the development rebate which remains unabsorbed and is carried forward to the next assessment year is by reason of clause (ii) of Explanation 1 to be set off not merely against the profits or gains of the particular business but against the total income of the assessee for that year. Therefore it is only where the amount of development rebate has not been fully set off against the total income of the assessee in the past assessment years and a part of it still remains unabsorbed and is carried forward to the assessment year in question that it can be allowed against the profits or gains of the business for the particular assessment year and if there is still is some balance outstanding, then against the other income of the assessee for that assessment year. But if the amount of the development rebate is wholly set off against the total income of the assessee in the past assessment years and there is no unabsorbed development rebate to be carried forward to the assessment year in question, there would be nothing in respect of the past development rebate to be set off against the profits or gains of the business under clause (ii) of Explanation 1. [1151 D-H, 1152 A-B] (6) As sub-section (3) of Sec. 15C provides that the profits or gains of a new industrial undertaking shall be computed under Sec. 10, and therefore, according to clause (vi) read with proviso (b), no part of depreciation allowance and according to clause (vi-b) Explanation 1, no part of the development rebate in respect of the new industrial undertaking for the past assessment years can be allowed as a deduction in computing the profits and gains, unless 1141 it has remained unabsorbed by reason of inadequacy of the total income chargeable to tax in the post assessment years, and is carried forward to the assessment year in question.
 Total income means not only profits or gains derived from the new industrial undertaking but the totality of profits or gains computed under various heads.[1152 F-G] (7) There is nothing in sub-section (3) of Sec. 15C or in any other provision of the Act which requires that in computing the profits or gains of a new industrial undertaking under section 10, depreciation allowance or development rebate in respect of the new industrial undertaking for the past assessment years should be taken into account. even if it has been set off fully against the profits or gains of any other business carried on by the aesessee or against income under any other head and there is no unabsorbed depreciation allowance or development rebate to be carried forward. [1152 G-H, 1153 A] (8) Effect cannot be given to depreciation allowance and development rebate twice over, once in the past assessment years and again in the assessment year in question. To give effect to depreciation allowance or development rebate for the past assessment years even though it has been set off and absorbed completely against the total income of the assessee for those assessment years would be to allow a deduction not warranted by any provision of the Act and indeed it would be going contrary to the express provision of proviso (b) to clause (vi) and Explanation 1 to clause (vi-b). Sub-section (3) of Sec. 15C clearly does not have any such effect. What it does is no more than provide as to how "the profits or gains derived from new industrial undertaking" referred to in sub-section (i) of Section 15C shall be computed. [1153 A-D] (9) Sub-section (3) of Sec. 15C does not enact any legal fiction providing that the profits or gains of the now industrial undertaking shall be computed as if the new industrial undertaking were the only business of the assessee from the date of its establishment or the past years depreciation or development rebate had not been set off against other income of the assessee The new industrial undertaking is not retrospectively quarantined or isolated from the other income producing activities of the assesee for determining its profits or gains for the purpose of applicability of sub-section (1) of section 15C. What sub- section (3) of section 15C does is meanly to lay down the same rule of computations for the profits or gains of a new industrial undertaking as in respect of any other business and, therefore, neither depreciation allowance nor development rebate in respect of the new industrial undertaking for the past assessment year can be allowed as a deduction in computing the profits or gains for the assessment year in question, except where and to the extent to which, it has not been set off against the total income of the assessee for those assessment years and has remained unabsorbed. This is the plain and undoubted effect of the language used in sub-section (3) of section 15C. Indeed the language is so clear and unambiguous that it is impossible to place any other construction upon it. [1153 E-H 1154 A] (10) Apart from the language of the section, if the construction contended for on behalf of the Revenue and upheld by the High Court. as well as the Tribunal were accepted, it would lead to the highly anomalous result that though, for the purpose of computing the total income chargeable to tax. the depreciation allowance and development rebate which have been set off against 1142 the other income of the assessee for the past assessment years would not be liable to be taking into account, they would have to be deducted in computing the profits or gains of the business for the purpose of applicability of subsection (1) of Section 15C. Thus, there would be two different modes of determining the profits or gains of the business, one for computing the total income chargeable to tax and the other for applying the provisions of subsection (1) of Section 15C. Such a consequence could never have been intended by the legislature [1154 A-C]
