 The appellants were carrying on business in ghee. On the labels of the tins of ghee the name of the business premises of the appellants and the postal division were given but the number of premises and the locality where the premises was situate were not given. On the ground that the label did not conform to the packing and labeling rules as required under r. 32(b) and (e) of the rules made under s.
 23(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, the appellants were prosecuted and were convicted, and a token fine of Re. 1 was imposed on them. The judgment of the High Court emphasised upon the violation of r. 32(e).
 Rule 32(e) provides that every label should specify the batch number or code number either in Hindi or English numerical or alphabets or in combination, and r. 32(b) requires the name and address of the manufacturer or importer or vendor or packer to be given on every label.
 The first proviso to r. 32 excludes the operation of cls.
 (a) to (e) of the said rule in respect of food packages weighing not more than 60 grams.
 On the question whether sub-rr. 32(b) and (e) were within the rule making power under s. 23(1) cls. (c), (d), (f), and (g).
 
HELD:(1) The sub-rules could not have been made under cl. (c). That clause deals with provisions for imposing rigorous control over production, distribution and sale of any article or class of articles of food notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette. But no such notification regarding ghee had been issued by the Central Government.
 [474B] (2)Clause (f) relates to prohibiting the sale or defining the conditions of sale of any substance injurious to health when used as food. This clause also has no application because ghee is not a substance injurious to health when used as food. [474C] (3)Clause (g) will have no application because one of the essential requirements therein is that the rules made under it should be related to the interest of public health. Any rule made under this clause must be of universal application because it is in the interest of public health. The requirement regarding compliance with any such rule cannot depend upon the quantity of food packed in any container.
 Therefore, the fact that food packages not weighing more than 60 grams are excluded under the proviso to the rule is an indication that r. 32 is not framed under s. 23(1) (g) of the Act. [474D-F] (4)The object of a rule framed under s. 23(1) (d) must be with a view to preventing the public or the purchaser being deceived or misled as to the character, quality or quantity of the article. The giving of the 467 batch number or code number alone without giving any further particulars such as the date of manufacture of the article and the period within which the said article has to be used or consumed and the quantity of the article in the container will not prevent the public or a purchaser from being deceived or misled as to the character, quality or quantity of the article. [474G-H; 475A.-B] In the present case there was no obligation to specify on the label the date of packing and manufacture of the article of food or the period within which the article of food has to be used or consumed. In the :absence of any such obligation there is no rational or even a remote connection between the batch or code number artificially given by a packer and the public or purchaser being prevented from being deceived or misled as to the character, quality or quantity of the article contained in a sealed tin. [475C-E] Therefore r. 32(e) is beyond the rule making power even under s. 23 (1) (d) of the Act. Since r. 32(e) is invalid the appellants could not have been convicted for its violation. [475E-F] (5)But r. 32(b) is within the rule making power under s.
 23(1) (d), because, it is well known that in many cases in business the name and address of a manufacturer or importer or vendor or packer has become associated with the character quality or quantity of the article. [476B] In the present case, there is a substantial compliance with the rule by the appellants, but according to the requirement of the rule, some more particulars will have to be given, namely, the number of the premises and the locality or the area where the premises was situate. There was thus a technical breach of r. 32(b). [476B-D] [But since there was no indication from the judgments of the lower courts that the appellant would have been convicted for such a technical breach if there was no charge under r.
 32(e) also, the appellants were acquitted.] [476E-F]
