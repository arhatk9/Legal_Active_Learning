 The petitioner in a petition under Art. 32, challenged the validity of Regulations 855 and 856 of the Madhya Pradesh Police Regulations made by the Government under the Police Act, 1961. Regulation 855 provides that where on infor- mation the District Superintendent believes that a particular individual is leading a life of crime, and his conduct shows a determination to lead a life of crime that individual's name may be ordered to be entered in the surveillance register, and he would be placed under regular surveillance. Regulation 856 provides that such surveillance, inter alia may consist of domiciliary visits both by day and night at frequent but irregular intervals.
 It was contended that, (1) the Regulations were not framed under any provision of the Police Act, and (2) even if they were framed tinder s. 46(2) of the Police Act, the provisions regarding domiciliary visits offended Arts.
 19(1)(d) and 21.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : (1) The Regulations were framed under s. 46(2)(c) of the Police Act and have the force of law. The paragraph provides that the State Government may make rules generally for giving effect to the provisions of the Act; and one of the objects of the Act is to prevent the commission of crimes. The provision regarding domiciliary visits is intended to prevent commission of offences, because, their object is to see if the individual is at home or gone out of it for commission of offences. [949 F-G, H-950 A] (2) (a) Too broad a definition of privacy will raise serious questions about the propriety of judicial reliance on a right that is not explicit in the Constitution. The right to privacy will, therefore, necessarily, have to go through a process of case by case development. Hence, assuming that the right to personal liberty. the right to move freely throughout India and the freedom of speech create an independent fundamental right of privacy as an emanation from them it could not he absolute. It must be subject to restriction on the basis of compelling public interest. But the law infringing it must satisfy the compelling state interest test. [954 B-C, H-955 B; 956 B-C] (b) Drastic inroads directly into privacy and indirectly into fundamental right will be made if the Regulations were to be read too widely. When there are two interpretations.
 one wide and unconstitutional, and the other narrower but within constitutional bound,;, the Court will read down the over flowing expressions to make them valid. [955 D-E; 956 G] (c) As the Regulations have force of law, the petitioner's fundamental right under Art. 21 is not violated. [955 H] (d) It cannot be said that surveillance by domiciliary visit-, would always be an unreasonable restriction upon the right of privacy. It is only persons who are suspected to be habitual criminals and those who are determined to lead a criminal life that are Subjected to surveillance. If 'crime' in this context is confined to such acts as involve public peace or security, the law imposing such a reasonable restriction must be upheld as valid. [956 C-D, F-H] [Legality apart, these regulations ill-accord with the essence of personal freedoms and the State will do well to revise these old Police Regulations. Domiciliary visits and picketing by the police should be reduced to the clearest cases of community security and should not become routine follow up at the end of a conviction or release from jail, or at the whim of a police officer.] [957 A-C] 947 Kharak Singh v.
