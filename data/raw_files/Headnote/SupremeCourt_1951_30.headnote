 Where a Court has sanctioned an agreement or compromise in a suit to which a minor is a party after satisfying itself that it is for the minor's benefit, the decree based on the agreement or compromise cannot be held to be invalid or not binding on the minor merely because the sanction of the Court was not obtained by the next friend or guardian before he began to negotiate for the agreement or compro- mise.

 549 Awadesh Prasad Missir v. Widow of Tribeni Prasad Missir (I.L.R. 19 Pat. 343) disapproved.
 The rule that in the case of a partition between members of a joint Hindu family one of whom is a minor, if the minor, on obtaining majority, is able to show that the division was unfair and unjust, the court will set it aside, does not apply to decrees in partition suits in which the minor was properly represented before the court. The decree is as binding on him as on the adult parties unless the minor can show fraud or negligence on the part of his friend or guardian ad litem.
