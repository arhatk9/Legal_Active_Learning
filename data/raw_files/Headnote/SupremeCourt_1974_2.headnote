 Immediately after he had obtained delivery of a parcel from the railway authorities, the appellant was apprehended by a railway constable. The parcel was found to contain 95,000 capsules of a sedative agent commonly used for intoxication.
 He was charged with the offence of stocking for sale a misbranded drug without a licence under S. 18(a) (ii) and s.18(c) read with S. 27(a) (ii) and 27(b) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the trial Court convicted him. The District Judge on appeal, acquitted the appellant. The High Court on further appeal sentenced the appellant to a minimum Sentence of one year's imprisonment prescribed by the Act.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Sections 18(a), 18(c) and 27(a) do not use the word "stock." in any technical sense. The plain meaning of the word "stock" in these provisions of the Act is "to keep" and the injunction of the law means no more than this that no person shall keep for sale a misbranded drug or a drug in respect of which a valid licence is not held. It is not necessary that the drug should be 'stored' in a place in order that it can be said to have been "stocked" for sale.
 If any one keeps or carries a drug on his person in contravention of the terms of the Act and it is proved that the drug is kept or carried for sale, the act must fall within the mischief of the law. What is "Intended for sale" can as much be stocked on one's person as in a shop or in a godown. "Keeping" for sale is of the essence of the matter, not the mode and the manner of keeping. To keep for sale is to stock for sale. [86C] In the instant case a large quantity of capsules found in the possession of the appellant leaves no doubt that he had stocked or kept the drug for sale.
