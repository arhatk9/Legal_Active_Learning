 The respondents were convicted by a Magistrate under s. 326 Indian Penal Code. They appealed to the Court of the Sessions judge who set aside the conviction and directed the case to be committed to the Court of Session. On revision the High Court set aside the order holding that the Sessions judge had, in an appeal against conviction, no power to direct commitment to the Court of Session.
 Held, that the words of s. 423 (1) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly empowered an appellate court to order commitment for trial to the court of Session. The power was not limited to cases exclusively triable by a court of Session.
