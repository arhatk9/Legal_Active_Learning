 In the general elections held in June 1980, the appellant fought as a Congress(1) candidate from Harlakhi Assembly constituency in Bihar and was declared elected. The respondent who was defeated filed an election petition in the Patna High Court listing a large number of persons through when corrupt practices were alleged to have been practised by the appellant. Since the copy of the petition, though attested by the election petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy, contained several mistakes which were of a very vital character, the appellant contested the petition alleging that the mandatory provisions of section 83(3) of the Representation of People Act not having been complied with at all, the petition should be dismissed in limine without going into the merits of the case. Though the High Court found as a fact that a large number of mistakes were there in the copy of the election petition supplied to the appellant. Yet, as they were of a superficial and insignificant nature bordering on clerical or typing mistakes, on the whole, there was a substantial compliance of the provisions of Section 81(3) of the Act. Hence the appeal against the interlocutory order.
 Allowing the appeal and dismissing the election petition the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1:1 A perusal of Sections 81(3) and 86 of the Representation of the People Act reveals that the statute intended that before an election petition can be entertained, the copy sent to the elected candidate must be a true copy, failing which there would be a serious disobedience of the mandate contained in s.81(3) which would be fatal to the maintainability of the said petition. [281 F] 1:2 It is now well settled by a large catena of authorities of this Court that the electoral process by which the verdict of the people has been given is a sacrosanct one and cannot be lightly set at naught unless the grounds mentioned in the Act for setting aside an election are held to be proved. In these circumstances, it is manifest that the provisions of s.81(3) of the act should be construed to the letter and spirit of the law because if the election petitioner does not give full and complete notice of the allegations made against the returned candidate, he runs the risk of his petition being dismissed in limine. [281 G-H] 279 2 On a careful consideration and scrutiny of the law on the subject, the following principles are well established;
 (1) that where the copy of the election petition served on the returned candidate contains only clerical or typographical mistakes which are of no consequence, the petition cannot be dismissed straightway under s.86 of the Act, [283 F] (2) A true copy means a copy which is wholly and substantially the same as the original and where there are insignificant or minimal mistakes, the court may not take notice thereof, [283 G] (3) where the copy contains important omissions or discrepancies of a vital nature, which are likely to cause prejudice to the defence of the returned candidate, it cannot be said that there has been a substantial compliance of the provisions of s.81(3) of the Act, [284 A] (4) Prime facie, the statute uses the words "true copy" and the concept of substantial compliance cannot be extended too far to include serious or vital mistakes which shed the character of a true copy so that the copy furnished to the returned candidate cannot be said to be a true copy within the meaning of s.81(3) of the Act, and [284 B] (5) As s.81(3) is meant to protect and safeguard the sacrosanct electoral process so as not the disturb the verdict of the voters, there is no room for giving a liberal or broad interpretation to the provisions of the said section.

 3. In the instant case, the mistakes in the copy supplied to the returned candidate related to corrupt practices, have to be proved to the hilt just like a criminal charge and any mistake which contains an element of vagueness would immediately vitiate the election petition and merit its dismissal under s.86 of the Act. Among the many more mistakes given in Schedule I, the few selected items themselves are vital and may seriously prejudice the defence of the appellant because it will be very difficult for him to find out the persons, named in the copy supplied to him who are said to have indulged in corrupt practices at his instance. The present case is a much worse case than Murarka Radhey Shyam Ram Kumar's case (supra) where only a slight difference in the title led this Court to hold that the mistake was a vital one was a valid one. Further, the omission of names cannot be said to be a typing mistake but a very vital and serious on which is sufficient to entail the dismissal of the election petition.
