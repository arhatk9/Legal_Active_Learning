 Section 9(2) of the Central Sales-tax Act, 1956 provides that the authorities for the time being empowered to assess, re-assess, collect and enforce payment of any tax under the general sales-tax law of the appropriate State shall, on behalf of the Government of India, assess, re-assess, collect and enforce payment of tax, including any penalty, payable by a dealer under this Act as if the tax or penalty payable by such a dealer under this Act is a tax or penalty payable under the general sales-tax law of the State.
 Section 16 of the Bombay Sales-tax Act provides for Payment and recovery of tax. Sub-section (4) states that if the tax is not paid by any dealer within the prescribed time, the dealer shall pay a penalty in addition to sales-tax assessed.
 The assessee unsuccessfully contended before various sales- tax authorities as well as before the High Court that levy of penalty under s. 16(4) of the Bombay Sales-tax Act for delay or default in payment of tax under the Central Sales Tax Act was without jurisdiction as it was not warranted by the provisions of s. 9(2) of the Central Sales-tax. Act, 1956.
 In the Mysore case which was similar to the Bombay case, however, the High Court allowed the assessee's claim that the levy of penalty under the Mysore Sales-tax Act in respect of sales-tax payable under the Central Sales-tax Act was ultra vires.
 It was contended before this Court that there was no provision in the Central Sales-tax Act for imposition of penalty for delay or default in payment of tax and, therefore, imposition of penalty under the provisions of the State Act for delay or default in payment of tax was illegal.

 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The Mysore High Court correctly pointed out that the words "as if the tax or penalty payable by such a dealer under this Act" relate to tax or priority which is payable only under the Central Act. [763B] The provision in the State Sales Tax Act imposing penalty for non-payment of sales-tax within the prescribed time is not attracted to impose penalty on dealers under the Central Sales Tax Act in respect of tax and penalty payable under the Central Act. There is no lack of sanction for payment of tax. Any dealer Who would not comply with the provisions for payment of tax would be subjected to recovery proceedings under the Public Demands Recovery Act. A penalty is a statutory liability. The Central Act contains specific provisions for penalty. Those are the only provisions for penalty available against the dealers under the Central Act. Each State Sales Tax Act contains provisions for penalties. Theses failure to provisions in some eases are also for failure to submit a return or register-. It is rightly said that those provisions cannot apply to dealers under the Central Act because the Central Act makes similar provisions. The Central Act is a self- contained code which, by the charging section-, creates Iiability for tax and which by other sections creates a liability for penalty and imposes penalty. Section 9(2) of the Central Act creates the State authorities as agencies to carry out the assessment. re-assessment. collection and enforcement of tax and penalty payable by a dealer under the Act. [765H; 766A-B] 754 (1)The words 'assess, re-assess, collect and enforce payment of tax including any penalty payable by a dealer under this Act' mean that the tax as well as penalty is payable only under the Central Act. By s. 9(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act the State Sales-Tax Authorities are created as agents of the Government of India. [76ID; B] (2) The words "and for this purpose they may exercise all or any of the powers they have under the general sales-tax law of the State" in s. 9(2) of the Central Act relate to "assess, re-assess, collect and enforce payment of tax in- cluding any penalty payable by a dealer under this Act." In that context the last limb of s. 9(2) of the Central Act, namely, "and the provisions of such law .... ...... shall apply accordingly" means that the provisions of the State, Act ire applicable for the purpose of assessment, reassessment, collection and enforcement of payment of tax including penalty payable under the Central Act. The words of the last part of s. 9(2) namely, "shall apply accordingly" relate clearly to the words "and for this purpose" with the result that the provisions of the State Act shall apply only for the purpose of assessment, re- assessment, collection and enforcement. [761G-H; 762A] (3) The extent of liability for tax as well as penalty is not attracted by the doctrine of ejusdem generis in the application of the provisions of the State Act in regard to assessment, re-assessment, collection and enforcement of payment of tax including any penalty payable under the Central Act. The doctrine of ejusdem genereis shows that the genus in s. 9(2) of the Central Act is 'for this pur- pose'. In other words, the genus is assessment, re- assessment, collection and enforcement of payment. The genus is applicable in regard to the procedure for assessment, reassessment, collection and enforcement of payment. The genus is from whom to collect and against whom to enforce. [762A-C] (4) The deeming provision in the Central Act that the tax as well as penalty levied under the Central Act will be deemed as if payable under the general sales tax law of the State, cannot possibly mean the tax or penalty imposed under any State Act will be deemed to be tax or penalty payable under the Central Act. The entire authority of the State machinery is that "for this purpose" meaning thereby the purpose of assessing, re-assessing, collecting and enforcing payment of tax including any penalty payable under the Central Act, they, meaning the State agencies, may exercise powers under the general sales tax law of the State. The words "for this purpose" cannot have the effect enlarging the content of tax and the content of penalty under the Central Act. Liability to pay tax as well as liability to pay penalty is created by the Central Act. [762D-E] (5) If the liability to pay tax is determined by the provisions of the Central Act the liability to pay penalty is also that which is payable under the Central Act. The procedural law prescribed in the general sales-tax law of the State applies to the matter of assessment, re- assessment, collection and enforcement of payment of tax under the Central Act because the liability to pay tax is determined tinder the Central Act. Similarly liability to pay penalty is determined with reference to the provisions of the Central Act. [763D] State of Kerala v. P. P. Joseph & Co., 255 STC 483;
 followed.
 (6) Rebate is a concession whereas penalty is an imposition.
 The concession does not impose liability but penalty does.
 It, therefore, stands to reason that rebate is included within the procedural part of collection and enforcement of payment of tax. Penalty, like imposition of tax, cannot be included within the procedural part. [763G-H] Orissa Cement Limited v. The State of Orissa & A Anr., 27 S.T.C. II 8; followed.

 (7) Penalty is within assessment proceedings just as tax is within the assessment proceedings when the relevant Act by substantive charging provision levies 755 tax as well as penalty. Penalty is not merely a sanction.
 It is not merely an adjunct to assessment. It is not merely consequential to assessment. It is not merely machinery.
 Penalty is in addition to tax and is a liability under the Act. penalty is not a continuation of assessment proceedings and penalty partakes of the character of additional tax.

 (8) Under a taxing statute liability does not begin on assessment. There must be a liability created by the Act, the Act must provide for assessment and the Act must provide for enforcement of the taxing provisions. The mere fact that there is machinery for assessment, collection and enforcement of tax Ind penalty in the State Act does not mean that the provision for penalty in the State Act is treated as penalty under the Central Act. The meaning of penalty under the Central Act cannot be enlarged by the provisions of machinery of the State Act incorporated for working out the Central Act. [765E-F] Jain Brothers & Ors.. v. Union of India, [1969] INSC 326; 77, I.T.R. 107 and Chattura & Ors. v. Commisioner of Income-tax, Bihar, 15, I.T.R. 302, followed.
 Per BEG, J. (1) The provisions relating to penalties are special and specific provisions in each Act. They are not part of "the general sales tax law" of either the State or of the Union. If the provisions relating to penalties, such as those found in the Central Act and the State Acts, are really special provisions which can be invoked in the special circumstances given in each statute, the reference to penalties in the concluding portion of s. 9(2) must be interpreted to relate only to the special provisions relating to penalties provided for specifically in the Cen- tral Act. [782B-C] (2) The rule to be applied with regard to a statute purporting to impose a charge is "that the intention to impose a charge upon the subject, must be shown by clear and unambiguous language". If the language leaves room for coming to the conclusion that only penalties specified in the Central Act are enforceable by the machinery for enforcement of liability under the general sales tax law of a State, then, the legislative intent could safely be presumed to be to confine penalties mentioned in the concluding part of S. 9(2) to only those mentioned speci- fically in the Central Act. [782F-G] Oriental Bank Corporation v. Wright, [1880] 5 App. Cas. 842 @ 856 referred to.
 (3) Section 76(a) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 repealed the Bombay Sales Tax Act of 1953. Section 16 of the 1959 Act refers to an entirely different subject matter. At the time when the assessment order was made, there was no provision for imposition of any penalty under s. 16(4) of the Bombay Act of 1953 which the Sales Tax Authorities and the High Court sought to utilise to justify the penalty imposed. [777G-H] (4) In 1956 the Parliament could not have applied its mind to provisions which came into existence afterwards. It could not have incorporated them by reference as parts of a procedure applicable to assessments which took place after 1959 when the Bombay Act of 1953 was repealed. At the time of the passing of the Central Act, the relevant statute in existence in Bombay was the Bombay Act, 1953. But s. 16(4) of the Bombay Act of 1953 under which the sales tax authorities purported to act, did not exist on the statute book at the time of assessment. Unless it is assumed that s. 9(2) of the Central Act, by necessary implication, authorised the State Legislatures to go on imposing such penalties for such breaches of duty as it pleased them to Jay down on behalf of Parliament, subsequently enacted Provisions of State enactments would not be available.[718A- C] Re. Delhi Laws Act (1912) etc. [1951] INSC 35; [1951] S.C.R. 747 referred to.
 (5) Section 13 of the Mysore Sales Tax Act 1957 was entirely recast in 1958. it would be carrying the theory of referential legislation too far to assume that s. 9(2) of the Central Act, 1956 purported to authorise the State Legislatures to 756 impose liabilities in the nature of additional tax or penalties leaving their rates and conditions for their imposition also to be determined by the State Legislatures as and when the State Legislatures decided to impose or amend them. [778D] (6) On a consideration of the provisions of s. 16 (4) of the Bombay Act it seems clear that whatever may be the objects of levying a penalty, its imposition gives rise to a substantive liability which can be viewed either as an additional tax or as a fine for the infringement of the law.
 It views an imposition of a pecuniary liability which is comparable to a punishment for the commission of an offence.
 [779B] (7) The imposition of a pecuniary liability, which take the form of a penalty or fine for a breach of a legal obligation, cannot be relegated to the region of mere procedure and machinery for the realization of tax. Such liabilities must be created by clear, unambiguous, and express enactment. The language used should leave no serious doubts about its effect so that the persons who are to be subjected to such liability for the infringement of law are not left in a state of uncertainty as to what their duties or liabilities are. [779D] (8) The provisions of s. 9(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act make it clear that the powers of the State Sales Tax Officers were specifically limited by the provisions of the Central Act. They cannot go beyond these provisions. it is also clear from s. 9(2) that these powers are exercisable only "for this purpose". In other Words, they are not authorised to collect dues for purposes extraneous to the Central Act. [781H] Per Mathew and Chandrachud, JJ. (dissenting) (1) A careful analysis of s. 9(2) of the Central Act would show that the authorities empowered to assess, reassess, collect and enforce payment of tax payable under the general sales tax law of the appropriate State shall assess, re- assess, collect and enforce payment of tax including penalties payable by a dealer under the Central Act as if the tax or penalty payable by a dealer under the Central Act is a tax or penalty payable under the general sales-tax law of the State and for that purpose, the authorities may exercise all or any of the powers they have under the general sales tax law of the State. [767F-G] (2) If the sales-tax authorities of a State have power, when enforcing payment ofsales-tax payable under the general sales-tax law of the State to impose penaltyfor non-payment of tax within the prescribed time, they will have a like power to impose penalty, for enforcing payment of the tax payable under the Central Act-within the time prescribed.
 It was not necessary that power to impose penalty for enforcing the payment of tax payable by a dealer under the Central Act should have been specifically provided in or conferred separately by the sub-section upon the sales tax authorities of the State, because, the power to enforce payment of tax payable under the Central Act, in the same manner as the power to enforce tax payable under the general sales-tax law of the State, has been given by it. The provision for imposition of penalty in s. 16 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act facilitates the collection of tax as it is a sanction for non-observance of the duty to pay the tax within the prescribed time. It operates as a deterrent against the commission of breach of that duty, and is a means to enforce the payment of tax within the time prescribed. [767H; 768A-D] C. A. Abraham Unnoottil v. The Income Tax Officer [1960] INSC 235; [1961] 2 S.C.R. 765, Narsddi Krishna Reddy v. Income Tax Officer, Tenali (1957) 31 I.T.R. 678. Commissioner of Income Tax v.

 (3) If rebate can be given on the basis that it would facilitate, expedite and stimulate the collection of tax there is no reason why a penalty could not be imposed to expedite, facilitate and stimuate the collection of tax and as part of the process of collection. Payment of rebate is a liability from the point of view of the Revenue, though it is a concession from the point of view of the assessee. If penalty is levy of money on an assessee, rebate means payment of money to an assessee [770C-D] 757 (4) It is difficult to hold that Parliament invested the State authorities with Power to assess, re-assess, collect and enforce payment of tax payable under the Central Act as if the tax 'is a tax payable under the general sales tax law of the State, but denuded them of the power to invoke the provision in the general salestax law of the State for imposition of penalty for enforcing payment of the tax payable thereunder, as that is an effective means to the enforcement of payment of tax within the prescribed time.
 [770F-G] (5) The analogy of principal and agent has no relevance in this context. If the power of enforcement of payment of tax payable under the Central Act conferred on the authorities of the State would include the power to impose penalties provided in the general sales tax law of the State there is an end of the matter. The whole falacy in the reasoning of the High Court is the assumption that only the penalties provided in the Central Act can be imposed by the authorities by using the machinery of the sales-tax law of the State as they alone are specifically mentioned in s.
 9(2) and in ignoring what are the powers actually conferred by the words enforce payment of tax as if the tax payable by such a dealer under this Act is a tax payable under the general sales tax law of the State" in the subsection.
 [772A-B] (6) It is clear from s. 9(2) that the penalties which could be imposed by the State authorities by virtue of the express provision in it are the penalties provided in s. 10 read with s. 1OA. [772H] (7) Where s. 9(2) says that assessment, re-assessment" collection and enforcement of payment of tax due under the Central Act should be made by the authorities of the State as if the tax payable under that Act is tax payable under the general sales-tax law of the State and for that purpose "they may exercise all or any of the powers they have under the sales tax law of the State", there can be no manner of doubt that if for enforcing payment of tax due under sales- tax law of the State, they have power to impose penalty, they have the same power of imposing penalty for enforcing payment of tax payable under the Central Act. The reason why the sales tax authorities of the State were given specific power under s. 9(2) to enforce the penalties payable by a dealer under the Central Act is that those penalties were not and perhaps could not have been provided for in the sales-tax law of the State. The penalties provided in s. 10 read with s. 10A of the Central Act are not for the purpose of or in connection with assessment, re- assessment, collection and enforcement of payment of tax payable by a dealer under the Central Act and could not have been imposed by the sales tax authorities of the State in making assessment, re-assessment, collection or in enforcing payment of the tax payable under the Central Act.
 Therefore, express power had to be conferred upon the sales tax authorities of the State to enforce the penalties payable by a dealer under the Central Act. [773C-G.] (8)'In the nature and scheme of the Central Act. it was not necessary to provide for imposition of penalty or for the other methods of enforcing the payment of tax payable under the Central Act since Parliament has adopted the machinery provided in the general sales tax law of the State as respects enforcement of the tax payable under the Central Act. [774E] (9) The expression "penalties" in the latter part of the s.
 9(2) can only refer to penalties imposable under the general sales tax law of the State in connection with assessment, re-assessment, collection and enforcement of payment of tax.
 The latter part of the sub-section only enumerates some of the powers exercisable by the sales-tax authorities of the State to assess, re-assess, collect and enforce payment of tax payable under the Central Act. The language of the sub- section beginning with "and for this purpose they may exercise all or any of the powers they have under the general sales tax law of the State, and the provisions of such law, including provisions relating to returns, provisional assessment, advance payment of tax .... appeals, reviews, revisions, references, refunds, penalties makes it clear that the word 'Penalties' occurring therein can refer only to penalties provided in the general sales-tax law of the State. In other words the express mentionof the power to impose 'penalties' among the enumerated powers beginning withthe words "and the provisions of such law including the provisions relating topenalties" would put it beyond doubt that the word "penalties" 758 in the latter part of the sub-section can only refer to penalties imposable under the general sales tax law of the State in relation to assessment, re-assessment, collection and enforcement of payment of tax payable thereunder.
