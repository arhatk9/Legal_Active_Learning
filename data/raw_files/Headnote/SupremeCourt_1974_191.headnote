 Section 13(a), Civil Procedure Code, 1908, makes a foreign judgment conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon except where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;' and s. 41, Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides that a final judgment of a competent Court in the exercise of matrimonial jurisdiction is conclusive proof that the legal character which it confers or takes away accrued or ceased at the time, declared in the judgment for that purpose.
 The appellant and respondent, who were Indian citizens were married in India in 1955. The respondent left for the U.S.
 in 1959 and from 1960 to 1964 was living in Utah for sometime as a student and thereafter in employment. Since 1965 he had been in Canada. He filed a petition for divorce in November 1964 in Nevada, and obtained a decree against the appellant in December 1964. The appellant did not appear in the Nevada Court, was unrepresented and did not submit to its jurisdiction.
 In 1965, the appellant moved an application for maintenance under s. 488, Criminal Procedure Court, 1898, and the respondent relied upon the divorce decree of the Nevada Court as a complete answer to the appellant's claim. The trial court held in favour of the appellant and the order was confirmed in revision. In further revision, the High Court held in favour of the respondent on the basis that 'at the crucial time of the commencement of the proceedings for divorce the petitioner was domiciled' in Nevada, that during marriage the domicile of the wife follows the domicile of the husband, that it was decided in Le Mesurier v. Le Mesurier [1895] A.C. 517 that 'according to international law, the domicil for the time being of the married pair affords the only test of jurisdiction to dissolve their marriage, and that therefore, the Nevada Court had jurisdiction to pass the decree of divorce.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : The decree of divorce passed by the Nevada Court in U.S.A. could not be recognised in India. [212F] (1) The question as regards the recognition to be accorded to the Nevada decree depends on the rules of Indian Private International Law. Our notions of a genuine divorce and of substantial justice and the distinctive principles of our public policy must determine the rules of our Private International Law. But awareness of foreign law in a parallel jurisdiction would be a useful guideline in determining these rules. [200 F-G; 211 A-B] Shorn of confusing refinements, a foreign decree of divorce is denied recognition in American Courts if the judgment is without jurisdiction or is procured by fraud or if treating it as valid would offend against public policy. The English law on the subject, prior to the passing of the Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separation Act, 1971, has grown out of a maze of domiciliary wilderness but English Courts have; by and large, adopted the same criteria as the American Courts for denying validity to foreign decrees of divorce. (206p;
 207 A-B] (2) The Judgment of the Nevada Court was rendered in a civil proceeding and therefore its validity in India must be determined on the terms of s. 13, 198 C.P.C. It is beside the point that the validity of that judgment is questioned in a Criminal Court in India. if the Judgment falls under any of the clauses (a) to (e) of s.
 13, it will cease to be conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon. The Judgment will be open to collateral attack on the _grounds mentioned in the five clauses of s.
 
13. (213 C-E] (3) Under s. 13(e), the foreign Judgment is open to challenge 'where it has been obtained by fraud.' Fraud as to the merits of the case may be ignored, but fraud as to the jurisdiction of the Nevada Court is a vital consideration in the recognition of the decree passed by that Court. Though it is not permissible to allege that the Court is taken by it is permissible to allege that the Court was 'misled'.
 The essential distinction is between 'mistake, and 'trickery'. [213 E-H] The Duchess of Kingston's Case, Smith's Leading Cases, (13th Ed) Vol. II, 644 at p. 651, referred to.
 (4) Domicil being a jurisdictional fact, the Nevada decree is open to the collateral attack that the respondent was not a bona fide resident of Nevada, much less was he domiciled in Nevada. The recital in the judgment of the Nevada Court is not conclusive and can be contradicted by satisfactory proof. [211 D-F] (5) The facts of the present case establish that the respondent went to Nevada as a bird of passage, resorted to the Court there solely to found jurisdiction and procured a decree of divorce on a misrepresentation that he was domiciled in Nevada. Prior to the institution of the divorce proceedings, he might have stayed but he never lived, in Nevada. Having secured a divorce decree he left Nevada immediately thereafter rendering false his statement in the petition for divorce that he had 'the intent to make the State of Nevada his home for an indefinite period,' The concept of domicil is not uniform in all jurisdictions and just as long residence does not by itself establish domicil, brief residence may not negative it. But residence for a particular purpose fails to satisfy the qualitative test, for, the purpose being accomplished the residence would cease. The two elements of factum et animus must concur.
 Thus, the decree of the Nevada Court lacks jurisdiction and cannot receive recognition in Indian Courts. [212 D-F] (6) The judgment to operate as conclusive proof under s.
 41, Evidence Act, has to be of a 'Competent Court', that is, a Court having jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. Even a judgment in rem is open to attack on the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction, and s. 44 of the Evidence Act gives the right to a party to show that a judgment under s. 41 was delivered by a Court. not competent to deliver it, or was obtained by fraud or collusion.
 Fraud, in any case bearing on jurisdictional facts, vitiates all judicial acts whether in rem or in personam; and no rule of private international law could compel a wife to submit to a decree procured by the husband by trickery. [213H-214 D, G] R. Viswanathan v. Rukn-vl Mulk, [1962] INSC 208; [1963] 3 S.C.R. 22, 42, followed.
 (7) The High Court wrongly assumed that the respondent was domiciled in Nevada; and in this view, the Le Mesurier doctrine on which the High Court relied, loses its relevance. (212 F-G]
