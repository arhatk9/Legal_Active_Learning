 The respondent, who was appointed a Sub-Inspector of Police, was posted in Delhi in 1949. A Deputy Superintendent of Police, in the City of Delhi who had already retired from service was directed to conduct a departmental inquiry against the respondent. The enquiring Officer was reemployed from the date of retirement as a Deputy Superintendent of Police (Enforcement Department), and after such reemployment, had conducted the enquiry against the respondent and found him guilty. Thereupon the Superintendent of Police, Delhi Police Force, ordered the dismissal of the respondent. The respondent's suit challenging the dismissal was decreed and the decree. was confirmed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, on the questions : (1) Vhether an officer functioning as a Superintendent of Police but was not designated as a District Superintendent of Police was competent to pass the order of dismissal; (2) Whether the officer, entrusted with the enquiry was a police officer competent to hold the inquiry; and (3) Whether the procedure prescribed by Rule 16.38 (1) and (2) of the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, was followed before holding the departmental enquiry.
 
HELD : (1) Though the Police Act, 1861, uses the expression 'District Superintendent of Police' and the Punjab Police Rules use the expression 'Superintendent of Police' the two expressions refer to one and the same authority. Under R.
 
1.8 of the Punjab Police Rules, there could be -more than one Superintendent of Police in a district. Since the police force expanded considerably between 1861 when the Act was passed and 1934 when the Punjab Police Rule,-, were framed, a Magisterial district was divided into smaller areas for the better enforcement of law and order and a Superintendent was placed in charge of each such area. In the Delhi area there were two Superintendents of Police one for the city of Delhi and the other for New Delhi. The Superintendent of Police; City of Delhi, would therefore be the District Superintendent of Police for the purposes of the Police Act with jurisdiction over the police station where the'plaintiff was posted, and he was competent to pass the order of dismissal. [167 E-, 168 B-C, F] (2)Under R. 16.24 (1)(1) the officer conducting the enquiry must be an officer empowered to punish or such superior officer whom the superintendent might direct to conduct the enquiry. [168 H] In the present cam, the officer who conducted the enquiry had been re-employed as it Deputy Superintendent of Police in the Enforcement Department of the police force and had taken over charge from another Deputy Superintendent of Police. Therefore, he was a police officer superior to the respondent. [168 B, C-D, E] 164 (3)The file relating to the departmental enquiry against the plaintiff had been destroyed under the relevant police rule, long before the institution of the suit. There is thus no documentary evidence, but the oral evidence showed that the procedure, prescribed by R. 16.38 (1) and (2) had been followed. [171 B-C] State of U.P. v. Babu Ram, [1960] INSC 229; [1961] 2 S.C.R. 679 and Delhi Administration v. Chanan Shah, [1969] INSC 36; [1969] 3 S.C.R. 653, referred to.
