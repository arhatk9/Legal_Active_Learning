 S and H formed a partnership to carry on business in partnership as exhibitors of cinematograph films with effect from March 1, 1947. Each partner who was an owner of a cinematograph theatre brought his theatre into the books of the partnership as an asset of the partnership. For the assessment years 1950-51 to 1952-53 the Income-tax Officer allowed depreciation aggregating to Rs. 44,380/- in respect of the two theaters. The partnership was dissolved on September 30, 1951, and on dissolution it was agreed between the partners that the theaters should be returned to their original owners. In the books of account maintained by the partnership, the assets were shown as taken over on October 1, 1951, at the original price less the depreciation allowed-the depreciation being equally divided between the two partners. In proceedings for assessment for the year 1952-53 the respondent was treated as a registered firm.
 The Appellate Tribunal held that by restoring the two theaters to the two original owners "there was a transfer by the firm and the entries adjusting the depreciation and writing off the assets at the original value amounted to total recoupment of the entire depreciation by the partnership. and on that account" proviso 2 to s. lO(2)(vii) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, applied. The High Court. in reference, held in favour of the assesses. The Revenue appealed, contending, that on the transfer of the theaters from the partnership to the original owners there was a sale.
 
 HELD:The expressions "side" and "sold" are not. defined in the Income-tax Act: Those expressions are used in s.
 10(2)(vii) in their ordinary meaning. "Sale" according to its ordinary meaning is a transfer of property for a price.
 and adjustment of the rights of the partners in a dissolved firm is not a transfer, nor is it for a price. [176A-B] A partner may, it is true, in an action for dissolution insist that the assets of the partnership be. realised by sale of its assets, but where in satisfaction of the claim of the partner to his share in the value of the residue determined on the footing of an actual or notional sale property is allotted, the property so allotted to him cannot be deemed in law to be sold to him. 1176E] Addanki Naravanappa and Anr.
