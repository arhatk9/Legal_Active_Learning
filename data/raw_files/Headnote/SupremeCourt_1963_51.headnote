 The appellant bank suffered losses due to the partition of India. its scheme for reduction of capital was approved of by the Company judge subject to the condition that the Bank should accept without any payment surrender of ordinary shares on which part payment was made from any displaced person entitled to relief under s. 19 of the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment) Act, so as to relieve such person from liability to pay the calls made and to be made. A period of two weeks was given to displaced persons to exercise the option.
 The respondent was a share-holder of the appellant but he did not avail himself of the option given by the Company judge. Later on, he asked the appellant bank under s. 19 (2) of the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment) Act to convert his 500 ordinary shares into 250 fully paid-up shares. On the bank refusing to comply with the requisition, the respondent filed a petition under s. 19(4) of the Act for an order directing the bank to convert his 500 partly paid-up shares into 250 fully paid-up shares.
 The Tribunal granted the relief prayed for to the respondent. It also held that losses suffered by the bank and doubtful debts had been accumulating for a long time and the bank resorted to the scheme of capital reduction only after the passing of the Act of 1951 with a view to deprive the displaced share-holders of the benefit under the provisions of s. 19 of the Act. This view of the Tribunal was affirmed by a single judge and a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court. The bank appealed to this Court with special leave.
 Held, that the order directing the bank to convert the shares of the respondent into fully paid-up shares must be confirmed. No good cause had been shown by the ban for 232 declining to convert the partly paid-up shares into fully paid up shares. The expression "no cause for such refusal" within the meaning of cl. (4) must mean II no good cause for refusal.".
 Held, also that the order of the company judge sanctioning reduction of capital was not conclusive and binding and could not deprive a displaced person of the right granted by Act. The order of the Company judge sanctioning reduction of capital was subject to the provision of s. 19 of the Act.
 A displaced person was not obliged to avail himself of the option. A displaced person not desiring to avail himself of the option given under the order of the Company Judge could apply under s. 19 (4). The order of the Company judge was valid and binding subject to any order which the Tribunal might make in respect of any individual share-holder who applied under s. 19 (4).
