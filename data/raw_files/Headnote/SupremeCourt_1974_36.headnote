 The appellant was prosecuted under s. 142 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951 on contravention of an externment order issued under s. 56 of that Act. During the pendency of the criminal trial, the High Court, in a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution, quashed the order of externment on the ground that no opportunity to show cause was given against allegations relating to areas where the acts were alleged to have been committed. In criminal trial, the trial court acquitted the appellant. On appeal by the State the High Court convicted the appellant. It held that the accused had re-entered the forbidden area during the currency of the order. The High Court was of the view that the quashing of the order by the court did not render the order of externment void ad initio but it only invalidated the order with effect from the date of the issue of the writ quashing the order.
 On the question whether the externment order having been quashed by the High Court during the pendency of the criminal trial the order had become void ab initio and there being no quit order there was no offence.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : that an order which infringed a fundamental freedom passed in violation of the audi alteram partem rule was a 'nullity. A determination is no determination if it is contrary to the constitutional mandate of Art. 19. On this footing the externment order was of no effect and its violation was no offence. Any order made without hearing the party affected is void and ineffectual to bind parties from the beginning if the in jury is to a constitutionally guaranteed right. May be that in ordinary legislation or at common law a Tribunal having Jurisdiction and failing to hear the parties may commit an illegality which may render the proceedings voidable when a direct attack was made thereon by way of appeal, revision or review, but nullity is the consequence of unconstitutionality and so the order of an administrative authority charged with the duty of comply- ing with natural justice in the exercise of power before restricting the fundamental right of a citizen is void ab initio and of no legal efficacy. The duty to hear menacles his jurisdictional exercise and any act Is, in its inception, void except when performed in accordance with the conditions laid down in regard to hearing. [432 G. 436 F] An order which is void may be directly and collaterally challenged in legal proceedings. An order is null and void if the statute clothing the administrative tribunal with power conditions it with the obligation to hear, expressly or by implication. Beyond doubt an order which infringes a fundamental freedom passed in violation of the audi alteram partem rule is a nullity. When a competent court holds such official act or order invalid, or sets it aside, it operates from nativity, that is, the impugned act or order was never valid. [439 F] In the present case a fundamental right of the petitioner had been encroached upon by the Police Commissioner without due hearing. The Court quashed that order. The legal result Is that the accused was never guilty of flouting an order which never legally existed. [439; D-E] [The Court did not express its final opinion on the many wide ranging problems in public law of illegal orders and violation thereof by citizens.] [439 E] 428
