 The appellant was alleged to have entered into a conspiracy with others, to persuade members of the public to part with money for purchasing residential plots in a village, 'Khand Gawadi' and in furtherence of this conspiracy, they were alleged to have forged sale proceedings pattas, and the signatures of others on such pattas and sale proceedings.
 The appellant himself affixed his signatures as Sarpanch and put the seat of the village panchayat on the forged documents. The trial court held the appellant guilty of the offences of conspiracy under s. 120-B and he was also found guilty of the offences under s. 467 1. P. C. On appeal the High Court confirmed the appellant's conviction on both these counts, but reduced his sentence. The appellant's grievance before this Court was that non-consideration of his application under s. 561-A Cr. P.C. dated April 7, 1970, which was filed on May 1, 1970, but neither listed nor beard and has resulted in grave miscarriage of justice. On 18th May 1970, the Hon'ble High Court made an order as follows : "Perused application dated 7-4-1970 and 30-4-1970.
 1 have decided the case on 17-4-1970 and there is, therefore, no question of saying anything on the merits now". The second point strongly presented by the appellant is that the appellants conviction was based solely on the testimony of P.W. 1, the approver, whose evidence has not been corroborated in material parts.
 Allowing the appeal, HELD: (i) The application under s. 561-A Cr. P.C.
 should have been disposed of after hearing the appellant's counsel and its disposal without such hearing was clearly wrong and unjust. The appellant has a just grievance against the manner in which this application was disposed of. He had a right to be afforded a reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of his application, and the disposal of this case in the chamber of the learned judge without giving him such opportunity cannot be appreciated [469H] (ii) Section 133 of the Indian Evidence Act, expressly provides that an accomplice is a competent witness and the conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds on uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. But this Section has to read along with illustration (b) to s. 114. Section 114 empowers the court to presume the existence of certain facts and the illustrations elucidate what the court may presume. Illustration (b) in express terms says : 'that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars. The statute thus permits the conviction of an accused person on the basis of un- corroborated testimony of army accomplice. But the rule of prudence embodied in Illustration (b) of s. 114 strikes a note of warning that the court will not generally believe an accomplice unless be is corroborated in material parts.
 This rule is guided by long experience and has become a rule of prudence for general application. [470C-G] 464 (iii) So far as the charge under s. 120-B, 1. P.C. is concerned, in almost every case of conspiracy, it is generally a matter of inference, direct independent evidence being seldom. Inferences are normally deduced from acts of parties in pursuance of apparent criminal purpose in common between them. In the present case, the only evidence is of the approver and the trial court expressly observed that there is no other direct evidence of conspiracy. Therefore the charge of conspiracy cannot be sustained from the evidence available. [475G-476B] In the present case, on the existing evidence, the appellants conviction under s.467 I.P.C. was wholly unsustainable. Therefore, the appellants' conviction must be set aside. [475F]
