 The respondent Smt. Ram Chambeli leased out the suit premises to the appellants for a period of three years under an order dated December 22, 1977 passed by the Additional Rent Controller in Suit No. M/798/77 under section 21 of the Delhi Rent Control Act. On the expiry of the said period, when the respondent filed an application before the Rent Controller for possession of the premises, the appellants filed objections, highlighting how by suppression and falsifying facts the respondent resorted to the provisions of section 21 of the Rent Act, and challenged the need for personal occupation. The Additional Rent Controller, therefore, after hearing both sides revoked the permission granted in 1977. However, the Rent Control Tribunal set aside the order of the Addl. Rent Controller and ordered eviction. The High Court in Second Appeal confirmed Tribunal's order. Hence the tenant's appeal by Special Leave of the Court, Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the landlady is not entitled to invoke the remedy under section 21 of the Delhi Rent Control Act. The permission under section 21 of the Act had been obtained by her on the basis of wrong statement, but for which the permission would not have been accorded. These statements which were in the nature of half truths were apparently made in order to make good the plea that there was only a temporary necessity to lease out the building for a short period and that there was a bonafide anticipation that there would be a pressing necessity to reoccupy the premises at the end of the period, which were the two crucial factors governing and order under section 21 of the Act.

 2 : 1 It is true that the appellants who were the weaker of the two parties did not question the truth of the statements made by the respondent when the permission was granted. But such conclusion, if any, between the two unequal parties does not confer any sanctity on the transaction in question. In cases of this nature it is always open to the weaker of the two parties to establish that the transaction was only a camouflage used to cover its true nature. [296 H; 297 A] 291 2:2. Collusion implies the existence of two or more parties who can deal with each other independently with the object of entering into an arrangement which may serve as a cloak to cover up the real state of affairs. When one party can dominate over the will of the other, it would not be a case of collusion but one of compulsion. The above view is fully in consonance with the spirit behind the rule of oppression which is recognised as an exception to the doctrine that a party cannot recover what he has given to the other party under an illegal contract. The ground that the appellants cannot challenge the permission initially granted under section 21 of the Act is not, therefore, available in this case. [297 B-C] Smith v.
