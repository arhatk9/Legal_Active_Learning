 The petitioner was a delegate from the Co-operative Federation of Unchagaon to the Bulandshahr Distric Cooperative Federation. In the present writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution he challenged the orders of the Deputy Registrar Cooperative Societies (i) removing him and two other delegates from the membership 'of the Board of Directors of the Federation in exercise of powers under s.
 38 of the U.P. Cooperatives Societies Act 1965 on the ground that their Unions were defaulters in respect of their dues to the Federation thus attracting bye-law No. 1(Ta) of the Federation; (ii) annulling in exercise of powers under s.
 128 of the Act. The resolutions of the Committee of Management dated 15th March 1972 in favour of the petitioner and the other two other delegates on the ground that the minutes of the meeting in which the resolutions were passed were not recorded by the Secretary and the proceedings were thus in violation of bye-laws No. 10 (cha) and No. 11.
 Allowing the petition, 
HELD:(1) The Deputy Registrar could not rely on bye-law NO. 1 (Ta) to justify the removal of the petitioner and the two other delegates from the membership of the Board of Directors. The Federation was not a credit society. The Federation did not have any loan transaction with the co- operative unions. The co-operative unions did not have any loan transactions with the petitioner. The dues of the co- operative unions were in respect of supplies of goods by the Federation to the Co-operative unions. These were commercial transactions. These were commercial debts.
 Price of goods supplied if outstanding does not constitute loan within the meaning of the bye-law. The impugned order was entirely on an illegal basis and wrong interpretation of the bye-law. The order was bad. [435F-H; 436A-B] (2)The meeting of the Federation on 15th March, 1971 was properly conducted." The Chairman rightly appointed an elected Director to record the minutes of the meeting in view of the willful absence of the Secretary. Section 188 of the Act also protects the proceedings of the meeting.
 The Deputy Registrar acted illegally in annulling the resolutions of the Federation held on 15th March 1971.
