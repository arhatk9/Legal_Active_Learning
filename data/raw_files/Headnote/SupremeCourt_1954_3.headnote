 In the present case there were two meetings of the University Syndicate, consisting of twelve members. Proper notices of both meetings were issued to all the members but one member did not attend one meeting and another member did not attend the other meeting. The defeat was that the subject matter of the present case was not included in the agenda of either meeting but one of the items in the agenda of both the notices was " other matters, if any. " The subject matter consisted of leakage of examination papers and the cancellation of results. Those present passed the resolution on both occasions unanimously The High Court held that want of notice in the two cases invalidated the resolutions 884 and issued a mandamus directing the syndicate to take steps for the publication of the results Held, that want of due notice can be waived in given circum- stances. In the present case the two absentees did in fact attend one or other of the meetings and expressed their views, not individually but as members of a meeting which was considering the matter and there was unanimity on both occasions. The substance is more important than the form and if there is substantial compliance with the spirit and substance of the law, an unessential defect- in form should not be allowed to defeat what is otherwise a proper and valid resolution. As in the present case, there was actual appearance without objection at meetings properly convened and there was complete unanimity on both occasions the two resolutions were not invalid because whatever may be thought about each taken separately, the defects, if any, are cured when two are read together and regarded as a whole.
 Held further, that in a mandamus petition the High Court cannot constitute itself into a court of appeal from the authority against which appeal is sought. It is not the function of courts of law to substitute their wisdom and discretion for that of the persons to whose judgment the matter in question is entrusted. by the law.
 The present was not the sort of case in which a mandamus ought to issue.
