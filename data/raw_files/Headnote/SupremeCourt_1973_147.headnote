 Section 43(1) of the Bihar Hindu Religious Trusts Act, 1950, as amended in 1956, provides, that all disputes as to whether any immovable property is or is not a trust property shall be inquired into by the authority appointed by the State Government; and s. 67 of the Act provides that if a trustee fails without reasonable cause to comply with certain matters or furnish certain particulars which he is required or called upon to furnish under the Act, he shall be liable to punishment.
 The respondents, who were called upon to furnish certain particulars falling tinder s. 67, in relation to certain temples, contended, that there was no trust, that s. 43 provides a machinery for deciding whether there is a trust and who is the trustee of the trust, and that a decision under the section was a condition precedent to the launching of a prosecution under s. 67. The High Court accepted the contention.
 Allowing the appeals to this Court, 
HELD : Neither expressly nor by necessary implication, s. 43 or any other provision of the Act bars the prosecution tinder s. 67 without a decision under 43- [486 B] In a prosecution under s. 67, it is open to the persons prosecuted to contend that there is no trust and that they are not trustees. It would then be for the prosecution to make out all the ingredients of the offence and the two main ingredients are : (1) that there is a trust and (2) that the person prosecuted is a trustee. In that case, it will be for the Court before which the prosecution has been instituted to decide the questions on the material placed before it. There is nothing preventing the criminal courts from going into these questions. [484H-485C] Under s. 43, the only question that can be decided is whether any immovable property is a trust property or not.
 Under the section as it originally stood, the Board of religious trusts or any person interested in a religious trust may, at any time, apply to the District Judge for a declaration that any immovable property is trust property;
 and under the section, as amended in 1956, all disputes as to whether any immovable property is trust property, shall be inquired into by the authority appointed. But, in either case, the only question that can be decided under the section is whether any immovable property is or is not trust property. The section, before or after amendment, does not provide for a decision as to whether there is any religious trust or whether any person is a trustee. [485G-486B] It is possible that, when a question is raised before the authority under the section whether a certain immovable property is trust property or not, the person interested might contend that the was no trust at all. In such case.
 the authority, for the purpose of deciding whether the property is trust property. will have to decide whether there is a trust at all. But such a decision is. only for the purpose of deciding whether it has the jurisdiction to decide whether the property in question is trust property.
 if it wrongly decides that there is a trust and that it has jurisdiction. such a decision can be questioned in a civil court. In any case, under the section, it cannot be decided whether any body is a trustee. Thus, the only question that can be decided under s. 43 is 482 irrelevant to the case of the prosecution in respect of many of the offences mentioned in s. 67. [485D-G] Mahanth Ramdhan Purl v.
