 The assessee purchased shares by way of investment in 1939- 40 at a cost price which was much less than their market value on April 1, 1945. Her dividend income therefrom was assessed to income tax. In the financial year 1945-46 the assesee converted these shares into her stock-in-trade and carried on business in the shares. Per income for the assessment year 1946-47 was computed on the basis of the profits which she made by the sale of her shares as a trading activity. The assessee contended that the cost price of the shares for computing the profits was their market value at the beginning of the year when she started the trading activity, i. e., on April 1, 1945. The Department contended that the cost Price of the shares was the actual price for which they were purchased by the assessee, no matter when she bought them and for what purpose.
 Held (per Das, Kapur, Gajendragadkar, Subba Rao, Wanchoo and Ayyangar, jj. Sarkar, J., contra), that the profits 392 of the assessee from her business or trading activity must be computed on the basis that the market value of the shares as on April 1, 1945, was the cost price of the shares for the business. The basis must be the ordinary commercial principle on which actual profits are computed, and normally, the commercial profits out of a transaction of sale of an article are the differences, between what the article cost the business and what it fetched on sale. In Kikabhai Premchand v. Commissioner of Income-tax, the Supreme Court was considering the converse case and the principles laid down in that case were (1) that there was no general principle of taxation under income-tax law under which the State could assess a person on the basis of business profits that he might have made but had not chosen to make, and (2) that it was unreal to separate the business from its owner. Those principles have no application in the present case which is not a case of any potential future advantage; the admitted position in the present case is that there was a sale of the shares in question in pursuance of a trading or business activity and actual profits had resulted from the sale. The question here is how such commercial profits are to be calculated. In a trading or commercial sense the only fair measure of assessing such trading profits is to take the market value at one end and the actual sale proceeds at, the other. This is more in accord with reality than fiction.
 Sir Kikabhai Premchand v. Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Bombay, [1954] S. C. R. 219, Sharkey v. Wernher (1955) 36 T. C. 275, referred to.
 Per, Sarkar J.-The assessee's taxable profits on the sale of the shares earlier held as investment are the difference between the sale price and the price at which she had ac- tually bought those shares, The profits could not be compu- ted on the basis of a fictional sale by the assessee to herself on April 1, 1945. The case was governed by the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in Kikabhai's case. The decision of the House of Lords in Sharkey v.
 Wernher, which took a contrary view, was not preferable to that of the Supreme Court in Kikabhai's case.
 Sir Kikabhai Premchand v. Commissioner of Income- tax (Central), Bombay, ] 1954] S. C. R. 219, followed.
 Sharkey v. Wernher, [1955] 36 T.C. 2 75, not approved.
