 A son was born to the assessee, a Hindu, on December 11, 1952, and' it was common ground that the conception of the child must have taken' place sometime in March 1952.
 For the assessment year 1953-54 (accounting year April 1, 1952 to March 31. 1953) the assessee claimed that certain income received by him should be assessed as the income, of a Hindu undivided family, which, according to him had come into existence in or about March 1952 when the son was conceived. The Income Tax Officer however recognised the family as a Hindu undivided family only from the date of the birth of the child. This view was upheld by the appellate authorities and the High Court, upon a reference,.also answered the question against the assessee.
 It was contended on behalf of the assessee that under the Income-tax Act, a Hindu undivided family is a separate unit and in determining whether a Hindu undivided family exists or not, and if it exists, from what date it has come into being, regard must be had to the principles of Hindu Law, for the Act does not lay down any principles on this,point; that it is well settled and it is a substantive rule of Hindu Law that a son conceived has the same rights of property as a living son and that a joint Hindu family comes into existence from the date the son is conceived.
 
 HELD:The doctrine of Hindu Law that a son conceived is equal in, many respects to a son actually in existence is not of universal application and it applies mainly for the purpose of determining the rights of property and safeguarding such rights of the son. This doctrine does not fit in with the scheme of the Income Tax Act and it could not have between the intention of the legislature to have incorporated this special' doctrine into the Act. [758 F-G] In the present case,' no rights of the son would be affected by not recognising his existence for the purposes of s. 3 of the Act till he was actually born. Income-tax is a liability and it could not have been the intention of the legislature to impose a liability on unborn persons.

 (1964) S.C. 510; referred to.
 Even if a Hindu undivided family was in existence towards the end' of the accounting year, the whole income received or accrued in the accounting year did not thereby become the assessable income of the Hindu undivided family;
 till the child was born, the income was the assessee's income. [760 D]
