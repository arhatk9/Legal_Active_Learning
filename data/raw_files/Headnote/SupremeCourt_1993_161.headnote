 The appellant assessee, a firm which did business during the accounting years relevant to assessment years 1946-47 and 1947-48, was dissolved by a deed of dissolution dated December 2,1946, and Its business discontinued. Notices were issued in the name of the partnership firm and assessments were completed under the Income-tax Act 1922 and Excess Profits Tax Act, 1948. Indeed, the returns were flied in the name of the firm.
 During the course of the assessment proceedings under both the enactments viz. Income-tax and Excess Profit Tax Act, no objection was taken as to the validity of the proceedings. Against the orders of assessment, appeals were preferred to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. In these appeals also the validity of the assessment order was not challenged. Even In the further appeals before the Tribunal, no objection was taken to the validity of the assessments. Subsequently, however, permission was sought for raising additional grounds questioning the validity of the assessment proceedings. Though, Revenue opposed the same, the Tribunal permitted the said new ground to be raised on the ground that the Income-tax Officer was aware that the business of the firm was closed. Ultimately, the Tribunal dismissed the appeals. Thereupon the assessee obtained the reference and since it could not succeed even before the High Court the assessee filed the present appeals.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant see that under the unamended Section 44, no assessment could have been made upon a firm which was dissolved by the time the assessment was made.
 646 Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 
HELD:1.1. Section 44 of the Income-tax Act, 1922 (before Its Amendment by Finance Act, 1958) covered two situations: (1) where any business, profession or vocation carried on by a firm or association of persons was discontinued and (2) where an association of persons was dissolved. In either of these situations, every person who at the time of such discontinuance or dissolution was a partner of such firm or member of such association was made jointly and severally liable to assessment under Chapter IV in respect of the Income, profits and pins of the firm or association as the case may be. The joint and several liability extended to the payment of the tax. [650 C-D] 1.2.The instant case Is one where the dissolution of the firm resulted in discontinuance of its business. This Court is not concerned with the situation where the firm was dissolved but its business was not discontinued, a distinction which has to be borne in mind. In the case of dissolution resulting in discontinuance of business S.44 of the Income-tax Act, 1922 enabled the Income-tax Officer to make an assessment on the dissolved firm. Indeed this aspect is no longer res integra in view of the settled law.
