 The respondent used to be assessed to income-tax as karta of a Hindu undivided family. In a suit filed by members of his family against the respondent a compromise decree was passed. The Income-tax officer accepting the respondent's claim under s. 25A of the Income-tax Act that the family was partitioned, assessed the members of the family as individuals. Later the Income-tax Officer issued a notice under s. 34 of the Act to the respondent as karta of the Hindu undivided family requiring him to file a return for a year in which the members had been assessed as individuals on the ground that the respondent's income had escaped assessment. Thereupon the respondent. filed a writ petition in the High Court for quashing the said notice. As the assessment of the same income in the hands of the members of the family for the same year was not set aside the High Court held that the notice was invalid as the same income could not be assessed again in the hands of the Hindu undivided family by taking proceedings under s. 34 of the Act. In appeal to this Court :
 
HELD: (i) The Income-tax Officer had jurisdiction to initiate proceedings under s. 34 of the Act against the respondent as the karta of the Hindu undivided family.
 A Hindu undivided family is a separate unit of assessment.
 It is a distinct assessable entity. It is a 'person' within its definition in the Act. It is liable to be assessed to income-tax in respect of its income. A member of that Hindu undivided family is not liable to pay any tax in respect of any sum which he receives as a member of that family out of the income of that family. If the said Hindu undivided family has escaped assessment for any year the Income-tax Officer, subject to the conditions laid down in s. 34(1) 'of the Act, may issue a notice thereunder calling upon the said Hindu undivided family to submit a return of its income for that year and proceed to assess it in terms thereof. It is manifest from a combined leading of ss. 3, 14(1) & (2), 22(1) and 34(1) that the Income-tax Officer can issue a notice to a Hindu undivided family under s. 34 of the Act on the ground that it has escaped assessment. [72 F-H] The exercise of the option by an Officer to do one or other of the two alternatives(viz., to assess either the Hindu undivided family or members thereof separately) assumes knowledge on his part of the existence of thetwo alternatives. If the case of the Revenue be true, the Income-tax at the time he assessed the individual members of the family had no knowledge that a united family existed; he presumably proceeded on the basis that the said family bad really ceased to exist tinder the terms of the compromise decree. Ibis was, therefore, not a case of election between two alternative units of assessment, but an attempt to bring to tax the income of an assessable entity which had escaped assessment. The apart, under s. 3 of the Act, in the matter of assessment, there is no question of any election between a Hindu undivided 69 family and a member thereof in respect of the income of the family. If a Hindu undivided family exists under s. 3 of the Act the Income-tax Officer has to assess it in respect of its income. Indeed, under s. 14(1) of the Act, any part of the income received by its member cannot be assessed over again, While s. 3 confers an option on the Income-tax offcer to assess either the association of persons or the members of the association individually, no such option is conferred on him thereunder in the case of a Hindu undivided family, and its existence excluder. the liability of its members in respect of the income of the former received by the latter.
 [74 C-F] Commissioner of Income-tax, U.P. v. Kanpur Coal Syndicate, (1964) 53 I.T.R. 225: [1964] 8 S.C.R. 85 distinguished.
 If the assessment proceedings initiated under s. 34 of the Act culminates in the assessment of the Hindu undivided family appropriate adjustments have to be made by the Income-tax Officer in respect of the tax realised by the Revenue in respect of the part of the income of the family assessed on the individuals of the said family. TO do so is not to open the final orders of assessment, but in reality to arrive at the correct figure of tax payable by the Hindu undivided family. [75 C-D] Case law referred to.
