 The respondent Anil Singh was tried for the murder of Keshav Kumar, his erstwhile friend and classmate. The Trial Court convicted the accused and sentenced him to imprisonment for life. The High Court doubting the credibility of the eye-witnesses, discarded the prosecution case and acquitted the respondent.
 Allowing the appeals, it was, 
 HELD: (1) The scope of appeals under Article 136 of the Constitution is undisputedly very limited. This Court does not exercise its overriding powers under Article 136 to reweigh the evidence. Even if two views are reasonably possible, one indicating conviction and other acquittal, this Court will not interfere with the order of acquittal.
 But the Court will not hesitate to interfere if the acquittal is perverse in the sense that no reasonable person would have come to that conclusion, or if the acquittal is manifestly illegal or grossly unjust. [6l6A] State of U.P. v. Yushoda Nandan Gupta, AlR 1974 SC 753 and State of A. P. v. R. Anjaneyulu, AIR 1982 SC 1598, referred to.
 (2) The public are generally reluctant to come forward to depose before the Court. It is, therefore, not correct to reject the prosecution version only on the ground that all witnesses to the occurrence have not been examined. Nor it is proper to reject the case for want of corroboration by independent witnesses if the case made out is otherwise true and acceptable. [6l7B-D] (3) It is welt to remember that there is a tendency amongst witnesses in our country to back up a good case by false or exaggerated version. The Court should made an effort to disengage the truth from falsehood and to sift PG NO 611 PG NO 612 the grain from the chaff rather than taking an easy course of holding the evidence discrepant and discarding the whole case as untrue. [617C-D; 617F] Bankim Chander v. Matangini, 24 C.W.N. 626 PC and Abdul Gani v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1954 SC 31, referred to.
 (4) Invariably the witnesses add embroidery to the prosecution story, perhaps for the fear of being disbelieved. But that is no ground to throw the case overboard, if there is a ring of truth in the main. [6l7G] It is the duty of the Court to cull out the nuggets of truth from the evidence unless there is reason to believe that the inconsistencies or falsehood are so glaring as utterly to destroy confidence in the witnesses. It is necessary to remember that a Judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. One is as important as the other. Both are public duties which the Judge has to perform. [6l7G-H; 618A] (6) The Court gave its anxious consideration to all material facts and circumstances of the case and came to the conclusion that the decision of the High Court could not be supported.
