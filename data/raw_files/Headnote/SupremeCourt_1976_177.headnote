 Two vacancies arose for the selection posts of Industri- al Advisers in the Directorate General of Technical Develop- ment, for which some Development Officers including respond- ents Nos. 6 to 11 applied. These respondents filed a writ petition against the promotion of the appellant to these posts. The Government opposed the same. During the penden- cy of the petition which was later dismissed, the appellant made a representation to the Departmental Promotion Commit- tee for considering his preferential claim, but the same was not placed before the Committee. The appellant made further representation to the Government, but the Committee decided to recommend respondents Nos. 6 and 7 for the appointment.
 The appellant filed a writ petition against the implementa- tion of the recommendation, but the same was dismissed.
 Allowing the appeal and directing that the appellant's name be included in the list of eligible officers to be considered for promotion, the Court, 
 HELD: Under Rule 2 of the Directorate General of Techni- cal Development (Class I Posts) Recruitment (Amendment) Rules, 1974, a person belonging to the first category, failing which, persons belonging to the 2nd category; and persons in the 3rd category are, all and together, eligible for being considered for promotion, subject to the fixation of the field of choice under the Home Ministry's Memorandum dated May 16, 1957. The amended rule does not mean that Development Officers can be considered for promotion to the post of Industrial Adviser only in the. event that qualified persons from the. first two categories are not available.
 [224 D-F] (2) The Amendment Rules of 1974, contemplate on their plain language and are framed on the basis that the officer on special duty is in a separate grade from the grade of Development Officers. In the particular context in which the words "in the' grade" occur, they mean "in that particu- lar grade", indicating thereby that the two grades are different although their scale of pay may be identical. The practice by which an integrated list of officers is prenared according to the date. on which they acquire eligibility, not having the authority of law, is vitiated in the instant case because of the 1974 recruitment rules.
