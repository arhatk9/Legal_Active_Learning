 The appellant who killed a child in a cruel manner and injured others was tried and convicted under s. 302 Indian Penal Code, and his appeal before the High Court also failed. In his statement at the trial he did not specifically plead insanity but in both the courts the plea that being insane he could not be credited with the intention requisite for the offence alleged was raised on his behalf. appeal, by special leave, before the Supreme Court, it was urged his behalf that despite the provisions of s. 105 Indian Evidence Act the burden of proving that the accused had the requisite intention and therefore of proving that he was not insane was on the prosecution. The argument was sought to be supported by certain observations of the Court in Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar's case.
 
HELD: (i) The burden of proving the intention of the accused person, where intention is an ingredient of the offence is on the prosecution and this burden never shifts.
 But intention can sometimes be only proved from circumstances and therefore it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove the acts of the accused and the circumstances in which they were committed. If from these an ference of the requisite intention can be reasonably drawn, the prosecution must be deemed to have discharged its burden. [196 G-197B] (ii) Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code can no doubt be invoked by a person for nullifying the evidence adduced by the prosecution by establishing that he was at the relevant time incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that what he was doing was wrong or contrary to law. The prosecution need not give evidence about the capacity of the accused to know the nature of the act or that it was wrong or contrary to law because these are matters of presumption. Everyone is presumed to know the natural consequences of his act.
 Similarly everyone is presumed to know the law. It is for this reason that s. 105 of the Evidence Act places upon the accused person the burden of proving the exception on which he relies. [197 B-D] (iii) The second part of s. 105 lays down that the Court shall presume the absence of circumstances on the basis of which the case could be said to come under a General Exception. But this presumption is rebuttable and the accused can rebut it either by leading evidence or by relying upon the prosecution evidence itself. If upon the evidence adduced in the case whether by the prosecution or by the accused a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence including menses of the accused, he would be entitled to be acquitted. This is very different from saying that the prosecution must also establish the sanity of the accused at the time of the commission of the offence despite what has been expressly provided for in s. 105 of the Evidence Act.
