 The appellant was originally employed as a civilian clerk in the Royal Air Force, Quetta, but subsequently on application made by him to the Director General of Indian Medical Service, he was appointed as an additional clerk in the office of the Director General to deal with the work of the Indian Research Fund Association on the understanding that the average cost of the appointment together with leave and pensionary contributions thereon was to be recovered from the Association. The Public Service Commission approved of the appointment subject to the condition that this would not give him any claim to appointment in the Central Secretariat or its attached offices. On June 12, 1930 the appellant was confirmed in the additional post with effect from April i, 1930), and on April IO, 1931, he was transferred on "foreign service" under the Indian Research Fund Association, where he continued to serve till September 17, 1944. As a result of certain representations made by him in which he submitted that the post which he held was a permanent post in the regular establishment of the Director General, Indian Medical Service, Government decided that while continuing to hold the extra-cadre post which was originally sanctioned for the work of the Indian Research Fund Association, he would in future be employed on ordinary work in the office of the-Director General, but would continue to be subject to the existing disqualifications, namely that he would no claim to appointment in the regular cadre of the ministerial establishment of the office.
 923 Ultimately on March 30, 1948, he instituted a suit against the Union of India for a declaration that he was in the service of the Union of India as a member of the permanent regular ministerial establishment of the office of the Director General, Indian Medical Service. He contended, inter alia (1) that as the post in which he was permanently appointed in 1930 was not constituted into a separate cadre, that post must be held to be an addition to the regular establishment of the Director General, Indian Medical Service and, therefore, an integral part of the same cadre, and (2) that, in any case, as under the rules relating to "foreign service" in the Fundamental Rules, members of the regular establishment only could be sent on "foreign service" and as admittedly Government had sanctioned the transfer of the appellant on "foreign service," he must be held to be a member of the regular establishment of the Director General.
 Held, (i) that it was within the competence of the appro- priate authority to create an additional post outside the regular cadre of a particular office to which the post may be attached for purposes of administrative control, and Fundamental Rule I27 only lays down the principles in accordance with which the cost of the additional post shall be recovered;
 (2)That Fundamental Rule 113 was not applicable to the case as "he appellant did not belong to a cadre immediately before his transfer on "foreign service." The question whether it was open to the Public Service Commission to impose a condition on or give conditional concurrence to, the appointment of the appellant, was left open.
