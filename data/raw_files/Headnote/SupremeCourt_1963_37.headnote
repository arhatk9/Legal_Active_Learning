 The appellant passed a resolution providing for the use of a public bus stand constructed by it for stage carriage buses starting from and returning to the Municipal limits of Palai or passing through its limits. It also prohibited the use of any other public place or public street within the Municipal limits as a bus stand or a halting place. The respondents who were using that bus stand, were served with notices demanding the payment of the charges due from them.
 They preferred writ petitions before the High Court challenging the validity of the action taken by the appellant and praying for quashing the notices issued against them. The High Court accepted the contention of the respondents that the provisions of ss. 286 and 287 of the Municipalities Act stood repealed by implication by virtue of the provisions of s. 72 of the Travancore-Cochin Motor Vehicles Action appeal by special leave this court held :- Held, that at the basis of the doctrine of implied repeal is the presumption that the legislature which must be deemed to know the existing law did not intend to create any confusion in the law by retaining conflicting provisions on the statute book and, therefore, when the court applies this doctrine it does no more than give effect to the intention of the legislature ascertained by it in the usual way.
 Daw v. The Metropolitan Board of Works [1862] EngR 606; (1862) 142 E. R 1104, Great Central Gas Consumers Co. v. Clarke, (1863) 143 E. R.
 331, and Goodwin v. Phillips (1908) 7 C. L. R. 16, distinguished.
 88 In the present case, the proper construction of the two sets of provisions would be to regard s. 72 of the Travancore- Cochin Motor Vehicles Act as a provision in continuity with ss. 286 and 287 of the Travancore District Municipalities Act so that it could be availed of by the appropriate authority as and when it chose. The intention of the legislature was to allow the two sets of provisions to co- exist, because both are enabling ones and in such a position, it could not imply repeal.
 Deep Chand v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1959] Supp. 2 S. C.
 R. 8, Shyamkant Lal v. Rambhajan Singh, [1939] F. C. R. 193, and Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney General for the Dominion [1896] A. C. 348, referred to.
 As no action under s. 72 had so far been taken by the Government, it could not be said that a conflict would arise and, therefore, the resolutions of the Municipal Council still hold good and the appeals must be allowed.
