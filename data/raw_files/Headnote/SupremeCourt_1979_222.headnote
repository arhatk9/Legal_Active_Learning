 Pursuant to the complaint filed by the second respondent against the appellants under sections 292/293 read with section 34 of the Penal Code for alleged punitive prurience moral depravity and shocking erosion of public decency of the film Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram, the Metropolitan Magistrate recorded the statement of three witnesses, including the complainant, in a preliminary inquiry under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and holding that a prima facie case existed for summoning the appellants, made an order directing issue of summons for their attendance. The appellants applied against the order to the High Court of Delhi under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the High Court, being of opinion that a revision petition lay against that order, decided to entertain it under section 397 of the Code. As the certified copy of the order of the Metropolitan Magistrate was not filed along with the petition, it was rejected by the High Court on August 3, 1979, as not competent.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave the Court, ^ HELD:
 (Per Iyer J.) The opening words of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure contradict the contention whether the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 stands repelled when the revisional power under section 397 overlaps because nothing in the Code, not even section 397 can affect the amplitude of the inherent power preserved in so many terms by the language of Section 482. Still, a general principle pervades this branch of law when a specific provision is made; easy resort to inherent power is not right except under compelling circumstances. Not that there is absence of jurisdiction but that inherent power should not invade areas set apart for specific power under the same code. [1085 G-H, 1086A] While it is true that Section 482 is pervasive, it should not subvert legal interdicts written into the same code, such for instance, in section 397(2). In short, there is no total ban on the exercise of inherent power where abuse of the process of the Court or other extraordinary situation excites the Court's jurisdiction. The limitation is self-restraint, nothing more. [1086 A-B, G] 1082 The policy of law is clear that interlocutory orders, pure and simple, should not be taken upto the High Court resulting in unnecessary litigation and delay. At the other extreme, final orders are clearly capable of being considered in exercise of inherent powers, if glaring injustice stares the Court in the face. In between there is a tertium quid where it is more than a purely interlocutory order and less than a final disposal. The present case falls under that category where the accused complain of harassment through the Court's process. In this third category (tertium quid) the inherent power can be exercised. [1086G-H, 1087A] Merely because a copy of the order has not been produced despite its presence in the records of the Court, it cannot be said that the entire revisory power stands frustrated and the inherent power stultified. [1087D-E] When the order in original is before the Court, to dismiss the petition for non production of a copy of it is to bring the judicial process into pejoration and if a copy were so sacred that the original were no substitute for it some time could have been granted for its production which was not done. In law, as in life a short cut may prove a wrong cut. The content of the power so far as the present situation is concerned is the same, be it under section 397 or section 482 of the Code. [1087E-G] Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra, [1977] INSC 205; A.I.R. 1978 SC 47 at 51 followed.
 The Film Censor Board acting under section 5A of the Cinematograph Act, 1952, is specially entrusted to screen off the silver screen pictures which offensively invade or deprave public morals through over-sex. A certificate by a high powered Board of Censors with specialised composition and statutory mandate is not a piece of utter consequence.
 It is relevant material important in its impact, though not infallible in its verdict. But the Court is not barred from trying the case because the certificate is not conclusive.
 Nevertheless, the magistrate shall not brush aside what another tribunal has, for similar purpose found. [1088E-F] A Board's certificate does not bar the criminal Court's jurisdiction to try for the offences under sections 292/293 Penal Code. Once a certificate under the Cinematograph Act is issued, the Penal Code pro tanto will not hang limp. May be, even a rebuttable presumption arises in favour of the statutory certificate but could be negatived by positive evidence. An act of recognition of moral worthiness by a statutory agency is not opinion evidence but an instance or transaction where the fact in issue has been asserted, recognised or affirmed. The Court will examine the film and judge whether its public policy, in the given time and clime, so breaches public morals or depraves basic decency as to offend the penal provisions. A view of the film may tell more than volume of evidence will and maybe any court before making up its mind, may like to see the picture from the angle of Sections 292/293 I.P.C. There is no meaningful alternative for an intelligent eye. [1088G-H, 1089A, E, 1090A-B] Finality and infallibility are beyond Courts which must interpret and administer the law with pragmatic realism, rather than romantic idealism or recluse extremism. Yet, especially when a special statute (the Cinematograph Act) has set special standards for films for public consumption and created a special Board to screen and censor from the angle of public morals and the 1083 like, with its verdicts being subject to higher review, inexpert criminal Courts must be cautious to "rush in" and indeed must "fear to tread", lest the judicial process should become a public footpath for any highway man wearing a moral mask holding up a film-maker who has travelled the expensive and perilous journey to exhibition of his "certificated" picture. Omniscience is not the property of a judge. [1084E-F, 1089D] (Per Pathak J.) In a trial for the offences under sections 292/293 of the Indian Penal Code a certificate granted under s. 6 of the Cinematograph Act by the Board of Censors does not provide and irrebuttable defence to accused who have been granted such a certificate, but it is certainly a relevant fact of some weight to be taken into consideration by the criminal Court in deciding whether the offence charged is established. Regard must be had by the court to the fact that the certificate represents the judgment of a body of persons particularly selected under the statute for the specific purpose of adjudging the suitability of films for public exhibition, and that judgment extends to a consideration of the principal ingredients which go to constitute the offences under ss. 292 and 293 of the Indian Penal Code. At the same time, the Court must remind itself that the function of deciding whether the ingredients are established is primarily and essentially its own function, and it cannot abdicate that function in favour of another, no matter how august and qualified be the statutory authority.
