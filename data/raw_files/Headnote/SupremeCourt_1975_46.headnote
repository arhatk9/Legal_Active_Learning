 By s. 3 of the Rajasthan Cash Jagirs Abolition Act, 1958 all cash jagirs .sanctioned to the former princes were abolished. Sub-s. (2) of s. 3 provided for payment of compensation. The petitioners received compensation from 1958 to 1970. In 1970, however, they questioned the validity of s. 3 on the ground that it is violative of articles 31 and 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the petitions.
 
HELD : The petitioners have approached the court after inordinate delay and even then after enjoying the full benefit under the Act. The petitioners cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold in the same breath. Right to the compensation, of whatever nature or content. flowed from the abolition of the cash jagirs under the Act and acceptance of compensation gave a quietus to the claim to have the Act adjudged as ultra vires. The foundation of the compensation was the abolition of cash jagirs. [707G; F] State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ranojirao Shinde & Anr. [1968] INSC 73; [1968] 3 S.C.R. 489, distinguished.
