 The appellant filed a suit in the court of sub-Judge Kaithal for possession of a piece of land in exercise of his right of pre-emption against respondents 1 and 2 alleging that they had purchased the land from his father, Babu Ram under a registered sale-deed dated May 16, 1977 in total discharge of his right of pre-emption. He stated in the plaint that the cause of action had arisen on May 16, 1977 and hence the suit filed on January 29, 1977 was in time.
 The certified copy of the sale deed issued by the Registration Office recited that the land in question had been sold in favour of respondents 1 and 2 only. Respondents 1 and 2 filed their written statement on May 17, 1978 and took a plea of non-joinder of all necessary parties without producing the original sale deed with them. After a replication denying the plea of non-joinder was filed on June 14, 1978 by the appellant, the counsel for respondents 1 and 2 read out the original sale deed in which it had been written that one Munni Devi wife of Om Prakash was also a vendee along with respondents 1 and 2, where upon the appellant moved an application on June 15, 1978, under Order I Rule 10 read with order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking permission to amend the cause title and the pleadings. On contest, that trial court accepted the objection to the said application and dismissed the application and the suit. The first appeal before the Additional District Judge was dismissed and the second appeal before the Punjab & Haryana High Court was dismissed at the stage of admission without giving any reasons therefor.
 Hence the appeal after obtaining special leave of the Court.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1:1. A change in section 21 of the Limitation Act, 1963, by inserting a proviso to the effect that where the Court is satisfied that the omission to include a new plaintiff or defendant was due to a mistake made in good faith it may direct that the suit as regards him should be deemed to have been instituted on any earlier date, has been made to reduce the severity of 234 the previous law and not to deprive a plaintiff of his rights against that person, if the Court is satisfied of the bonafides of the mistakes. [238 H, 239 A-B] 2:1. In the instant case, the omission to implead Munni Devi as a defendant was due to mistake as gleaned from the pleadings. The certified copy of the sale deed in question was obtained from the office of the sub-Registrar, and in the said copy the name of Munni Devi was not shown as a vendee at all. On the date when the suit was filed i.e. on 29th January, 1978 or till the counsel read out the original sale deed the appellant did not know by any other means that there was any other vendee in addition to respondents 1 and 
2. The written statement was clearly drafted not mentioning her name, Even the original sale deed was not produced with the written statement but the contents were read out on June 14, 1978 after the replication was filed denying the plea of non-joinder of necessary parties. The fact that the appellants' father was the vendor does not lead to the presumption of his knowledge that Munni Devi was one of the vendees. In fact the appellant had nothing to gain by not impleading Munni Devi as a defendant. These circumstances lead to the only conclusion that the appellant had acted with due care and attention, within the meaning of the term "good faith" in section 2(h) of the Limitations Act, 1963, which the courts below failed to note. (2) The suit against Munni Devi should be deemed to have been filed on the date of the institution of the suit i.e.January 29,1978 itself, treating that as an "earlier date" referred to in the proviso to section 21 (1) of the Act, since there is no dispute that, if the suit had been filed against her also on January 29, 1978 it would have been in time and would not have suffered from the defect of non-joinder of necessary party; and because Munni Devi is a necessary party and has to be impleaded under sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of Order I of Code of Civil Procedure to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit, the amendment regarding the cause of action is unnecessary.
