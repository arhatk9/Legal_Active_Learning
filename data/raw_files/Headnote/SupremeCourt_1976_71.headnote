 When the fying squad checked a bus of the State Road Transport Corporation, it was found that the appellant, who was a ticket-examiner of the Corporation and whose duty was to check whether all the passengers had paid the fare and whether the conductor had issued tickets to the passengers, was on the bus; and that, though all the passengers in the bus had paid their fares the conductor had not issued 9 1/2 tickets. If the appellant were so minded, he could easily have detected the conductor's misconduct. The appellant was charged with the breach of Standard Standing Order 12(b) under the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1963, which governed the matter, and he was dismissed after a domestic enquiry. On his application under s. 31, Madhya Pradesh Industrial Relations Act, the Labour Court held that the enquiry was defective as it infringed principles of natural justice, but came to the conclusion, after considering the evidence adduced before it by the parties, that the dismissal was justified. The appellant's revision to the Industrial Court and writ petition in the High Court were dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended by the appellant that: (1) the charge did not amount to a 'major misconduct' under the Standing Orders; and (2) the Labour Court, having found that there was no proper domestic enquiry, should have ordered payment of wages till the date of the decision by the Labour Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : (1) Standard Standing Order 12(b) provides that "theft, fraud or dishonesty in connection with the business or property of the undertaking" shall amount to a major misconduct on the part of the employee. The appellant obviously colluded with the conductor in depriving the Corporation of its legitimate earnings. The appellant, having thus acted dishonsetly in connection with the business of the Corporation, was clearly guilty of a major misconduct. [803G-804C] (2) In a case where the domestic enquiry does not suffer from any defect, so serious or fundamental as to make it non est, the award of the Labour Court, based on the evidence produced before it relates back to the date when the order of dismissal was passed on the termination of the domestic enquiry; and so, the appellant was not entitled to any back wages.

 The observation in the Hotel Imperial case [1959] INSC 96; [1960] 1 S.C.R. 476, 487, that in the Phulbari Tea Estate case [1960] 1 S.C.R. 32, it was held that in a case where the employer makes good the defects in the domestic enquiry by producing necessary evidence before the Industrial Tribunal, the employer "will have to pay the wages up to the date of the award of the Tribunal" even if the award went in favour of the employer, is not correct. In the Phulbari Tea Estate case, the employers made no attempt to make good the defect in the domestic enquiry by producing necessary evidence before the Tribunal with the result 802 that the Tribunal, which found that the enquiry was vitiated, had no evidence before it to examine the legality or propriety of the order of dismissal. It was in that context that instead of being re-instated, the employee was given the alternative relief of compensation by payment of wages. [805F-806C] M/s. Sasa Musa Sugar Works (P) Ltd. v. Shobrati Khan [1959] 2 SCR 836, explained and distinguished.
 An enquiry blatantly and consciously violating principles of natural justice so as to amount to a pretence may, however, be equated with a total absence of an enquiry so as to exclude the application of the 'relation back' doctrine. [807 C-D]
