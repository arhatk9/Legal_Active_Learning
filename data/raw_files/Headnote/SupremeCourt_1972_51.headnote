 The respondent employee was appointed a Lower Division Clerk and after 5 years of service, the Administrator of the Municipal Corporation, purporting to carry out the orders of the St-ate Government, passed a general order dated 21st December 1967, stating that the age of compulsory retirement of all servants of the Corporation (other than Class IV servants) should be 55 years.
 The respondent had entered into service of the Municipal Board of Bhopal long ago. in 1967, the Board became a Corporation under the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956. As a result of the continuance of the service conditions of the employees of the former Municipal Board, the petitioner was to retire at the age of 60 (by notifica- tion dated 11th November, 1947), but in 1955, the Government of Bhopal by a Notification, applying the service regulations of Central Government employees, reduced the retiring age of the Respondent to 58. Under the Corporation Act of 1956, question relating to service conditions of the employees of the Corporation were to be regulated by bye- laws under S. 427 (I C) (b) of the Act and not by rules to be made by Government. The State Government by a Notification in 1967 further reduced the retirement age of all employees (except IV Grade employees) to 55 years. The validity of the Order dated 21st December 1967 of the Administrator was challenged by the respondent on the ground that the procedure laid down by the Act for amending a bye- law was not followed, and the High Court accepting this contention quashed the Government Notification dated 22nd December 1967 as well as the general order reducing the age of retirement. On appeal, it was contended that the pro- cedure laid down in S. 432 of the Corporation Act was not mandatory but was merely meant to give the Corporation concerned an opportunity of putting forward its views by means of a representation it may like to make with regard to any proposal to the Government to modify or repeal any bye- law so that the administrator, acting on behalf of the Corporation, could forego the right of the Corporation to make any representation,. The State, in its appeal contended that the rule making powers of the Government under S. 433 are very wide and the Government can make a rule if the Corporation failed to make a bye-law. The view of the High Court that the matter did not fall under S. 433 of the Act was assailed. Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (1) The procedure laid down in S. 432 of the Act is only applicable where there is an existing bye-law which appears to the Government to stand in need of modification or repeal wholly or in part. Therefore, the impugned notification does not fall under S. 432 of the Act. [358 G] 354 (2) Assuming that the impugned notification purported to publish a rule made under S. 433 of the Act, the condition precedent of previous publication in the Gazette for an amendment of a rule, laid down by S. 24 of the Madhya Pradesh General clauses Act 1957 had not been followed in the present case. Therefore no valid alteration in the age of retirement of the employee-respondent was made in accordance with law. The impugned notification is bad and quashed. [359 C, 360 D]
