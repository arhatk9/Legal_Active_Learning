 After this Court's decision in the Bariumn Chemicals Ltd. v.
 The Company Law Board [1966 3 S.C.R.] quashing the order of the Company Law Board passed under Cl. (b) of s. 237 of the Companies Act, 1956, the Court ordered that all the books papers and other documents seized under the order of the Board be deposited in Court and that the appellants would be entitled to receive them from the custody of the Court. On May 22, 1966, an order was passed under s. 19(2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, stating that "the Central Government considers it necessary to obtain and examine certain Papers and documents" and requiring the appellant company and/or its Managing Director to furnish to the Enforcement Officer the documents specified in the sche- dule to the Order on obtaining the same from the custody of the Court. The first six items in the Schedule related to five letters and one telegram While the seventh item mentioned all other books papers and other documents relating to the appellants in the custody of the Court.
 Sub-section (2) of s. 19 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act provides : "Where for the purpose of this Act the Central Government or the Reserve Bank considers it necessary or expedient to obtain and examine any information, book or other document in the possession of any person or which in the opinion of the Central Government or the Reserve Bank it is possible for such person to obtain and furnish. the Central Government or, as the case may be, the Reserve Bank may, by order in writing, require any such person (whose name shall be specified in the order) to furnish, or to obtain and furnish, to the Central Government or the Reserve Bank or any person specified ill the order with such information, book or other document." The appellants filed petitions under article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court to quash the Order dated May 22, 1966 on the ground. Matter alia, that the order was not in conformity with the requirements of sub-s. (2) of s. 19.
 The High Court dismissed the petition. In appeal by special leave, 
HELD : The impugned order is liable to be quashed on the ground that it does not satisfy the requirements of sub- section (2) of s. 19 of the Act.
 (i) The occasion for the exercise of the power under the sub-section arises when the Central Government considers it necessary, or expedient for the purpose of the Act to obtain and examine any information. book or 753 document. It is only when the said requirement is satisfied that the central Government can proceed in the manner indicated in the subsection. [760 H] (ii) The Word "considers it necessary" postulate that the authority concerned has thought over the matter deliberately and with care and it has been found necessary as a result of such thing to pass the order. Therefore, due application of the mind regarding the necessity to obtain and examine the documents in question is sine qua non for the making if the order. [761 D] (iii) A necessary. corollary is that mind has to be applied with regard to the necessity to obtain and examine all the documents-mentioned in the order. An application of the mind with regard to the necessity to obtain and examine only a few of the many documents mentioned in the order, while there has been no such application of mind in respect of the remaining documents, would not be sufficient compliance with the requirements of the statute. [761 G] (iv) The language of s. 19(2) of the Act points to the conclusion that while an order under it may be made with respect to "any information, book or other document" it is essential that "such information book or other documents" should be specified in the order. The word "such" points to the necessity of specifying the information book or other document in the order. The fact that penal consequences follow from noncompliance with an order made under sub-section (2) of s. 19 also highlights the importance of specifying the information book or other document in the order. [762 A] (v) In the present case the fact that an omnibus order was made in respect of all documents relating to the appellants, which were in the custody of the Registrar under the orders of this Court, including some of the documents which have not even been the remotest bearing on the matters covered by the Act, goes to show that there was no due application of the mind by the authority concerned. The element of due care and attention Which is an essential ingredient of the phrase "considers it necessary" is lacking in this case.
