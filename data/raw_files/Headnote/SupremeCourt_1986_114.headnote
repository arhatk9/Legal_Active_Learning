 The Respondent-assessee was a partner in the firm of Larsen and Toubro, upto 1946. On 7th/8th February 1946 that firm was converted into a private limited under the same name. In consideration of his interest in the firm, the assessee was allotted 53,486 Right shares of the company, as per section 81 of the Companies Act, 1956. During the next few accounting years upto the financial year 1953-54 during which the company became a public Ltd. company, the assessee acquired 2,994 shares of the said company and sold 1550 shares. The purchases and sales of shares of the said company were few and far between upto the financial year 1953-54 but these became larger in number and at close intervals in the next few succeeding financial years ending between 31.3.55 and 31.3.60. During the aforesaid period, the assessee had acquired 29,969 shares of the said company and sold 37366 shares thereby making a profit of Rs.
 1,65,581. Besides purchasing and selling equity shares of the said company, the assessee had also dealt in preference shares of the said company. The assessee had sold shares of Andhra Cement Co. in the financial year 1954-55, made purchases of shares of S.C.C. and I.C.C. in the years 1955- 56, 1956-57 and 1958-59 and also of shares of India Cement Co. and National Carbon in 1955-56 and also sold shares of Guest Keen Williams and Indian Cement Co. in 1958-59. During all these years the purchases and sales of equity shares of the said company were more marked than the purchase and sale of other shares. Besides the sale of equity shares of the said company and shares of other companies, the 1073 assessee had also sold some of his original shares of the said company held by him. For all the accounting years upto the year ending March 31st, 1958 he was assessed as an investor The Income Tax Officer on a reconsideration of the findings in earlier years took the view that the assessee was an investor only till March 31st, 1954 but that from the financial year 1954-55 the assessee was a dealer in shares and therefore, profits made by him during such years are liable to tax. me first Appeal before the Appellate Commissioner was rejected. The assessee therefore, filed a second appeal. In such an appeal before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that (1) the assessee never purchased equity shares of the said company from any outsider or any stranger except in a few cases from close friends or from members of the staff just to accommodate them; (2) that the shares that were acquired by the assessee were only right shares issued by the company to its existing shareholders;
 (3) that the assessee had to meet huge personal expenses and tax liability in the relevant accounting periods; (4) that the assessee had an overdraft account and he wanted to keep the said overdraft account within reasonable limit; (5) that the assessee wanted to nurse his investments in the company;
 and (6) that the assessee had to and was forced and compelled by circumstances to sell some of the shares acquired by him. In the premises, the assessee's contention was that the sales of the said shares were neither effected voluntarily nor with a view to make any profit nor under a profit making scheme, but were effected under compelling circumstances and as no assessee could be a trader by compulsion, the assessee was not a trader in respect of these shares. Two members namely Judicial Member as well as Accountant Member gave separate but concurrent opinions and came to the conclusion that the assessee was a dealer in shares and not an investor. me Tribunal held : (1) The assessee was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the said company. (2) The said company had ever since its inception expanding its business and asking good profits.
 (3) Its capital had increased and, therefore, right shares were offered to the existing shareholders. (4) The assessee had a substantial holding of equity shares in the company.
 (5) It was not obligatory on the assessee to acquire right shares. (6) In fact, the assessee was indebted to the bank and was having an overdraft account on which he was paying interest. (7) Not only right shares were sold by the assessee, but he 1074 had also sold some of the original equity shares held by him. In a reference to the High Court, the High court answered in favour of the assessee and held that the assessee was not a dealer in shares. Hence the appeal by certificate.
 Dismissing the appeals and the connected special leave petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. The Jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under section 66(1) of the Act of 1922 equivalent to section 256 of the Act of 1961 was lid ted to entertaining references involving questions of law. If the point raised on reference related to the construction of a document of title or to the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the statute, it is a pure question of law and in dealing with it, though the High Court might have due regard for the view taken by the Appellate Tribunal, its decision would not be fettered by the Tribunal's view. The High Court was free to adopt such construction of the document or the statute as appeared to it reasonable. Where the point sought to be raised on a reference was a pure question of fact, the finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal must be regarded as conclusive in proceedings under reference. If however, such a finding of fact was based on an inference drawn from primary evidentiary facts proved in the case, its correctness and validity were open to challenge in reference proceedings within however narrow limits. The assessee or the revenue could contend that the inference had been drawn on considering inadmissible evidence or after excluding admissible and relevant evidence and if the High Court was satisfied that the inference was the result of improper admission or exclusion of evidence it would be Justified in examining the correctness of the conclusion. It may also be open to the party to challenge a conclusion of fact drawn by the Tribunal on the ground that it was not supported by any legal evidence or that the impugned conclusion drawn from the relevant facts was not rationally possible and if such a plea was established, the Court might consider whether the conclusion was not perverse and should not, therefore be set aside. However, it was within those narrow limits that the conclusions of fact recorded by the Tribunal could be challenged in a reference t-o the High Court) Such conclusions could never be challenged on the ground that these were based on misappreciation of evidence. A conclusion 1075 reached by the Tribunal on the ground that it is a conclusion on a question of mixed law and fact, is no doubt based upon the primary evidentiary facts but its ultimate form is determined by the application of relevant legal principles. The need to apply the relevant legal principles tends to confer upon the final conclusion its character of a legal conclusion. In dealing with findings on questions of mixed law and fact the High Court, however, has to accept the findings of the Tribunal on the primary questions of facts; but it is open to the High Court to examine whether the Tribunal had applied the relevant legal principles correctly or not; and in that sense, the scope of inquiry and the context of the Jurisdiction of the High Court in dealing with such points was the same as in dealing with pure points of law, and not beyond that.

 1.2 What are the characteristics of the business of dealing in shares or that of an investor was a mixed question of fact and law. What is the legal effect of the facts found by the Tribunal and whether as a result the assessee could be termed a dealer in shares or an investor was a question of law. In between the domains occupied respectively by question of fact and law, there is a larger area, in which both these questions run into each other, forming, so to say conclaves within each other. These are mixed question of law and fact. The instant case is one of question of law and fact. [1088 F-G; 1089 D-F] 
 1.3 Where a person in selling his investment realised an enhanced price, the excess over his purchase price was not profit assessable to tax as income, but it would be so if what was done was not a mere realisation of the investment but an act done for making profit. The distinction between the two types of transactions is not always easy to make. Whether the transaction is of one kind or the other depends on the question whether the excess is an enhancement of the value by realising a security or a gain in an operation of profit-making. The assessee might invest his capital in shares with the intention to resell these if in future their sale bring in a higher price. Such an investment though motivated by a possibility of enhanced value, did not necessarily render the investment a transaction in the nature of trade. In the premises the totality of all the facts will have to be borne in mind and the correct legal principles applied to these. If 1076 all the relevant factors have been taken into consideration and there has been no misapplication of the principles of law then the conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal cannot be interfered with because the inference is a question of law, if such an inference was a possible one, subject, however, that all the relevant factors have been duly weighed and considered by the Tribunal the inference reached by the Tribunal should not be interfered with.

 2. Section 81 of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that if a company proposes to increase its subscribed capital by allotment of further shares, such shares should be offered to the existing share-holders of equity shares and the offer should be deemed to include a right to renounce the shares.
 The right to receive the new shares is embedded in the old 1077 shares. Therefore the moment, the issue of right shares are announced the original share was bound to depreciate because a larger number of people participate in the existing capital. Right shares were not acquired by the assessee as a matter of free choice. The assessee acquired those shares if the assessee did not do so, his capital would erode.
 Further, as the facts disclose, he had to find so much more money in order to acquire the shares and it was not always prudent to permit the overdraft account to swell. The true object in this case was to prevent depreciation in the value of the shares investment. The assessee also renounced some of his rights to get the right shares and thereby entered into these transactions to nurse his investments. In the background of the correlation of several factors, in the instant case, the action of the assessee was like a prudent investor and not of a plunger in the waters of trade. [1096 E-G; 1097 8; 1098 F; 1099 F] 
 3. Consideration of all relevant facts involves 1) appreciation of all the facts in their proper perspective.
 If that is not done it cannot be said that there has been consideration of all relevant factors. The Tribunal did not consider the relevant factors in their proper perspective and in particular, namely, (i) that the assessee was the Chairman of the company and in fact that if he did not participate in buying right shares there might have been adverse effect on the market so far as the shares of the company were concerned; (ii) that he had an overdraft with the Bank; (iii) and that he had to remit money to Denmark for the purchase of his house. And as such the attitude of a person entitled to right shares for judging whether he was a dealer and investor was not viewed in proper dimension but merely noted by the Tribunal resulting in the non- consideration of a vital factor leading to an erroneous inference. The Tribunal in this case has undoubtedly noted the assessee's contention of nursing the investment. The Tribunal, however, has not considered in its order the actual position as to how then nursing of the ; investment was necessary. Tribunal thus erred. In that view of the matter the High Court was justified in interfering with the conclusion reached by the Tribunal. There is no reason to interfere with the order of High Court.
