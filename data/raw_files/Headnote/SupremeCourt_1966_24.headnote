 The revenue authorities sanctioned mutation of the lands left by S, an Aulakh Jat of Tehsil Ajnala in Amritsar District of the Punjab, in favour of the appellants who were collaterals of S in the 8th degree. A suit for possession of the said lands was filed against them by the respondents who claimed the lands as descendants of K. According to them K was the daughter's son of M, a collateral of S in the 5th degree, and had been formally adopted by M as his son. The trial court held that the adoption of K was the usual customary appointment of an heir and that by the custom of Jats in Amritsar District an appointed heir was entitled to succeed collaterally in the family of his adoptive father and consequently K was the preferential heir to S. The first appellate court agreed with the trial court that the adoption of K was the customary appointment of an heir, but rejected K's claim to be preferential heir on various grounds. The High Court in second appeal held that under the customary law K, as the adopted son of M was entitled to succeed collaterally in his adoptive father's family; on this view it restored the trial Court's decree. The appellants came to this Court on certificate.
 
HELD: (i) There is a presumption that the entries in Riwaj-i-am are correct and if there is a conflict between Rattigan's digest and the Riwaj-iam, normally the Riwaj-i-am of the locality prevails.
 (ii) Under the customary law of the Jats in Amritsar District when the customary adoption is formal and the adopted son is completely transplanted in the-family of his adoptive father,' he is entitled to succeed to the collateral relatives of the adoptive father. This finding is in harmony with the Riwaj-i-am of the Amritsar District, is supported by judicial decisions, and is not in conflict with Art. 49 of Rattigan's Digest. On, the other hand if the customary adoption amounts to a mere appointment of an heir, the appointed heir is not entitled to succeed to the collateral' relatives of the adoptive father. This finding is in harmony with Art. 49 of the Rattigan's Digest and the judicial decisions, and is consistent with the Riwaj-i-am properly interpreted in the light of the decided cases.
 [398 C, D] (iii) It is a question of fact in each case whether the adoption by a Jat in the Amritsar District is formal or informal. The adoption is formal if the parties manifest a clear intention that there should be a complete change of the family of the adopted son, so that he ceases to be a member of his natural family and lose his right of collateral succession in the family and at the same time becomes a member of the adoptive father's family and acquires a right of collateral succession in the family.
 The Iosses of the right of collateral succession in the natural family is strong evidence to show that the adoption is formal and effects a complete change.
 394 in the family. On the other hand 'retention of the right of collateral succession in his natural family indicates that the adoption was informal by way of customary appointment of an heir. [398 E-G] (iv) In the present case the courts had found, and the finding was -amply supported by materials on the record, that the adoption of K was no more than a mere appointment of an heir by the custom of the Jats in the District of Amritsar. The onus to show otherwise was on the res- pondents. The fact that K succeeded to the lands left by his natural brother and by one of the collaterals of his natural family strongly indicated that the adoption of M did not effect a change in his family. K's adoption not being a formal one, he could not be a preferential heir to S. [398 H; 399 D] Case law referred to.
