 In September 1963 the respondent company intimated to the appellant-Board and the State Government of its intention to revise the rates of electricity on certain grounds. Both the State Government and the Board informed the respondent that they were not satisfied that there was any justification for the revision. The respondent, however, brought the rates into effect in November, 1963. Being of the view that the respondent was over charging the consumers in breach of the provisions of the 6th Schedule to the Electricity Supply Act, the appellant issued a notice to show cause why a Rating Committee under s. 57A should not be constituted for inquiring into the matter. The respondent justified the increase and also intimated that if its explanation was not accepted the issues involved would be referred to the arbitration of the Central Electricity Authority under para 16 of the Schedule read with s. 76 of the Act. As the respondent did not receive any intimation, it referred the matter to the arbitration of the Central Electricity Authority. The appellant, however, not being satisfied with the explanation given to the show cause notice appointed a Rating Committee.
 On a petition filed by the respondent, the High Court held that a dispute or difference between the Board and the Electricity Company which was referable to the arbitration of the Authority under para 16 of the 6th Schedule had arisen, and since pending such arbitration, no Rating Committee could be constituted because of the second proviso to s. 57A the constitution of the Rating Committee by the appellant was illegal and the Committee had no power to function.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD:There is no provision in the Act which makes a dispute between the Board and the licensee as to whether the provisions of the 6th Schedule had been complied with or not referable to the Central Electricity Authority. The second proviso to s. 57A does not contemplate holding up of the constitution of the Rating Committee merely on the ground that such a dispute was referred by the licensee to the Authority. [504 C-E] (a)Under s. 57A the State Electricity Board has power to interfere by the' appointment of a Rating Committee if it is satisfied that the licensee has over charged the consumers by committing a breach of any of the financial principles mentioned in the 6th Schedule. The second proviso to the section contains three conditions which are to coexist, if the Rating Committee was not to be constituted by the Board:
 (i) there should be an alleged failure of the licensee to comply with any provisions of the 6th Schedule; (ii) such alleged failure must raise a dispute or difference as to the interpretation of the said provisions or any matter arising therefrom; and (iii) and such difference or dispute had been referred by the licensee to the arbitration of the Authority under para 16 of that Schedule before a certain date. [497 H-498 B; 501 C-E; 502 F] In the present case, there is an allegation by the appellant Board that the licensee had failed to comply with the provisions of the 6th Schedule. It could also be assumed that the alleged failure raised a dispute or difference as to the interpretation of the said provisions or any matter arising therefrom, though it is not clear whether Parliament wanted, for purposes of s. 57A and para 16 of the 6th Schedule, that the Authority should be approached not merely for the interpretation of the provisions of the 6th Schedule but also for sundry matters of detail arising out of the provisions. As regards the third condition the dispute had been referred by the licensee to the arbitration of the Authority within the time allowed by the statute, but it was not a 493 reference under para 16 of the Schedule, because, the reference to arbitration by the Authority under that paragraph could be made by the licensee only. against the grantor of the licence, namely the State Government and not the Board. [501 E, 502CE ] (b)There is no agreement between the appellant-Board and respondent-compAny to refer any dispute to the arbitration of the Authority. There is no substance in the contention that para 16 of the 6th Schedule is a statutory provision for arbitration to which s. 46 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, would apply. (497 C; 504 C] (c) The State Government and the Board have been required by the Act to be vigilant and if they find that by any illegal manipulation in the financial structure the licensee is overcharging the consumers they have to step in. To that end the two Schedules, namely the 6th and 7th are made by the Act part of the licence issued by the State Government to the licensee under the Indian 'Electricity Act, 1910, and have effect notwithstanding any other inconsistent provisions or terms of that licence. The parties to the licence in spite of the incorporation of the provisions of the 6th Schedule continued to be the State Government and the respondent company, and therefore, if any of the provisions of that licence including incorporated provisions of the 6th Schedule provide for arbitration of a dispute the dispute, unless otherwise expressly indicated must be between the parties to the licence, namely the State Government and the respondent-company. Paragraph 16 of the 6th Schedule provides for arbitration clause and this arbitration clause is incorporated in the licence to which the State Government and the electricity company are parties. On its plain construction the alleged dispute or difference should be between the State Government and the respondent and that dispute or difference alone is referable to the Authority. There is no specific provision in the Act that the Board shall be substituted in the place of the State Government as grantor of the licence. Indeed, the functions of the State 'Government and the Board are well- defined under both the Acts and the Board , as such, is not substituted in the place of the State Government. [497 E-H.
 498 G; 499D] The Amalgamated Electricity Co. Ltd. v. N. S. Bathena, [1959] Suppl, 2 S.C.R 213, followed.
 (d)Section 76(1) of the Act as it stood at the relevant time, also dealt with arbitration but under that sub-section it is not all disputes with the Board that were referable to the Authority but only those referred to in sub-s. 2 (a), that is, only those cases for which the Act provides. There is no provision in the Act which makes a reference to the Authority compulsory in a dispute between the Board and the electricity-company relating to the non-compliance of the provisions of the 6th Schedule. [500 C-E] (e)Under s. 76 (2) there could have been an arbitration by two arbitrators. But such an arbitration would not have helped the licensee to prevent the appointment of the Rating Committee, because, that arbitration was not by the Authority as required by the second proviso to 57A. The mere fact that in similar circumstances the State Government could have been compelled to submit to arbitration of the Authority is not an adequate answer. [503 C-E] (f)It is true that if arbitration for any sort of non- compliance of the provisions of the 6th Schedule fell within the second condition of the proviso, and, there was a competent arbitration between the licensee and the State Government, the licensee could have possibly prevented the constitution of the Rating Committee by the State Government. But the interposition of the Board made all the difference, because, para 16 of the 6th Schedule contemplates a dispute between the State Government and the licensee and a reference to the Authority only of such dispute,. and not a dispute between the Board and the Company. [502 H-503B] (g)Section 60 of the 1948-Act cannot be invoked with a view to substitute the Board in the place of the State Government for the purpose of arbitration under para 16.
 After the 1948-Act came into force where the Boards were not constituted, the State Government had to departmentally implement the relevant provisions of' the Act and in their implementation the State Government had to incur debts and obligations, and entering into contracts, and other engagements for the purpose of' the Act. Under s. 60 as soon as the Board was constituted, all these liabilities were statutorily transferred to the Board and in cases where suits were filed or other 602Sup CI/74 494 legal proceedings were taken by or against the State Government they had to be continued or defended by the Board. But to say that para 16, that is the arbitration agreement between the State Government and the licensee was an obligation imcurred by the State Government within the meaning of s. 60 (1) would be to unnecessarily strain the language. [500 E-501 C] (h)Having regard to the urgency of the matter and the proviso to para 16 Parliament did not want to prevent the constitution of the Rating Committee except when there was an important dispute involving the interpretation of the provisions of the 6th Schedule and such dispute was already before the Authority. It may be that there is a lacuna in the legislation in the Board not being liable to submit to the arbitration of the Authority but if so, it is for Parliament to correct that. [503E, G]
