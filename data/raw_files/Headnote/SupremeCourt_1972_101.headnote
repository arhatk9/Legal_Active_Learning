 The Minimum Wages Act 1948 was enacted to provide minimum rates of wages in certain employment mentioned in the Schedule. Item No. 8 of part No. 1 of the Schedule refers to employment in stone-breaking or stone crushing. By notification under the Act minimum wages was fixed for those employed in stone breaking or stone crushing in Gulbarga District, Mysore State. The appellant Inspector was of the view that respondent No. 1 which was quarrying a variety of stone called Shahabad stone in Gulbarga District was engaged in the activity of stone breaking and stone crushing and since respondent No. 1 was in breach of some of the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder he adopted proceedings to enforce the provisions in the court of the Munsif Magistrate. Respondent No. 1 filed a writ petition in the High Court for quashing the said proceedings contending that its activity was not one of stone breaking or stone crushing but of mining limestone slabs. According to him after removing the layers of earth and the thick layers of limestone thin layers of limestone were brought out and these- were then cut tip into regular sizes and this did not amount to stone breaking or stone crushing. The High Court held that removing Shahabad stone involved breaking and crushing but on the view that what was broken or crushed was not 'stone' but in the nature of a mineral quashed the proceedings. In appeal by certificate, 
HELD : Per Vaidialingam and Palekar, JJ. Stone breaking and stone crushing in relation to limestone is that activity in which non-stratified limestone, recognised as rock, is broken or crushed into irregular fragments or sizes and then marketed or otherwise used. The more valuable and rarer stratified limestone which is suitable for use as dimension stone is not the stone commercially exploited for breaking and crushing. Hence the employment of quarrying Shahabad stone is not the same as the scheduled employment of stone breaking or stone crushing referred to in item 8 of the Schedule to the Minimum Wages Act. The High Court was, therefore right in quashing the proceedings. [87A-C] Madhya Pradesh Mineral Industry Association v. The Regional Labour Commissioner Jabalpur and Ors., [1960] INSC 70; [1960] 3 S.C.R. 476, applied.
 Per Mathew, J. (dissenting) There is no distinction between stone obtained by crushing or breaking of non-stratified rock and that obtained by cutting stratified rock, for the purpose of construing the word 'stone' in item No. 8 as stone obtained in both the cases is a piece of rock.[88H] In Venkataramaniyas Law Lexicon and in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary quarrying is defined to include cutting. When this Court in the cases of Mohanlal Devichand Shah and Madhya Pradesh Mineral Industry 84 Association said that employment in stone-breaking or stone- cushing refer to "quary operation "this court was fullyu alive to the process in-- volved in quarry operation [90F-H] It must therfore be held that employment in quarrying operation for extraction, of Shahabad stone is employment within the ambit of item 8 of Part I of the Schedule.
