 The Sub-Divisional Officers of Mirzapur and Chunar Tahsils, functioning as Compensation Officers under the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1952 prepared draft Compensation Assessment Rolls, and notified them in the Official Gazette as required by s. 46(1) (a) of the Act.
 A notice was also served on the respondent, who was entitled to compensation under the Act. The 'respondent filed objections and claimed higher compensation. The State Government was not given notice of the objections nor any intimation of the date of hearing- was sent to it. As a result of the objections, the Compensation ,awardable to the respondent was enhanced, and the final compensation Rolls were then signed and sealed. Nearly eight months thereafter, the State Government filed applications before the Compensation Officer for reopening the objection cases, and claimed to have made these applications on the 30th day of their knowledge about the revision of the Rolls. The respondent opposed the applications alleging that the State had knowledge of the proceedings, and asked for the production of certain documents to prove that the State Government had notice of the proceedings and the State, had, in fact, appeared through the Zamindari Abolition Naib Tahsildars to contest the objections. The State Government claimed privilege which was allowed by the Objection Officer. Thereupon the respondent challenged the claim of privilege in a writ petition to the High Court, where the respondent was also allowed to claim a writ of prohibition against the reopening of the objection cases. The Single Judge dismissed the writ petition, but on appeal, the Division Bench quashed the order of the Objection Officer holding the documents were privileged. It also issued a writ of prohibition. In appeal, 
HELD : Section 343 says that Government shall be a party to every proceeding and it was therefore necessary to join Government and to send it a notice of the objection. The definition of "person interested" is not an exhaustive definition and the interest of Government is manifest. When the section says that Government shall be deemed to be a party, it only means that Government can appear even if not joined. [977 G; 978 C] A notice to Government must be sent to the District Collector and till notice is so sent Government cannot be treated as served. [978 F] Every court and tribunal is entitled to reopen a proceeding which has proceeded ex parte, not because a party has failed to appear but because a notice has not been sent to a necessary party. [980 A-B] As the question whether the compensation officer would or would not allow the objection cases to be reopened still remained to be decided, the High Court was in error in issuing a writ of prohibition when the 971 Compensation Officer had jurisdiction to determine whether to reopen the proceedings. The question of jurisdiction can only be decided after it has been considered by the Compensation Officer and he proceeds to reopen the proceedings. [980 E-G]
