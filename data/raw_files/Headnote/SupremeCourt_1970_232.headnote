 Apprehending violent and destructive activities by the petitioners th police arrested them without a warrant and took them before the Magi irate to be bound over under s.
 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure No proceedings were drawn up under s. 107 before the arrest, and after they were taken before the Magistrate, on the report of the police, th Magistrate drew up the order under s. 112 and it was read over to th petitioners. Thereafter, under s. 117(3) the Magistrate asked the pettioners to execute an interim bond, and as the petitioners refused to do so they were remanded to custody. The-Magistrate did not take any sworn statement or make any enquiry into the truth of the information before asking for the interim bond and merely adjourned the case for examination of the petitioners without summoning any witnesses in support of the information.
 On the question of the validity of the detention, 
HELD : Under the scheme of the Code the Magistrate can only as for an interim bond if he could not complete the inquiry.
 The expression 'pending completion of the inquiry' in s.
 117(3) postulates commencement of the inquiry, which means, commencing of the trial according to summons procedure. The Magistrate cannot postpone the case and hear nobody and yet ask for the interim bond. [749 C-D] In the present case, if interim bonds were required from the petition the Magistrate ought to have entered upon the inquire and satisfied hi self, at least prima facie, about the truth of the information in relation to the alleged facts. Without making any such inquiry the Magistrate could not require them to be detained in custody. Therefore, the proceeding for asking interim bond and the remand to custody were completely illegal. [750 C] Sections 91 and 344 of the Code do not apply to persons like the petitioners who were brought before court under the provisions of Ch. VIII of the Code. [749 F] Madhu Limaye v.
