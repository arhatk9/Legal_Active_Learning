 Under s. 3(1) of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954, the post of Assistant Settlement Commissioner is a post under the Union of India to which the appointment is to be made by the Central Government.
 In exercise of this power the Central Government appointed the first respondent to the post by order dated 3rd September, 1955. Since the post was created by the President of India only for a period of 6 months the sanction for the post came to an end on 29th February 1956.
 The first respondent, how-ever, continued to function on the basis of sanction to its continuance given by the State Government. Thereafter, by an order dated 17th April, 1956, the State Government purported to terminate the services of the first respondent with immediate effect. After some correspondence, on February 18, 1959, the Central Government issued a memorandum that on the expiry of the period of one month given in the earlier memorandum of January 18, 1959 his services stood terminated with effect from February 18, 1959. The respondent filed a suit against the Central and the State Governments contending that both their orders terminating his services were illegal and invalid and for recovery of arrears of salary, and allowances. The trial court dismissed the suit. In appeal to the High Court, he contended that his service was validly terminated only by the memorandum dated 18th January 1959, issued by the Central Government, and that he was therefore entitled to arrears of Wary and allowances upto 18th February, 1959.
 This contention was accepted by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The Central. Government alone could terminate the appointment, both as the appointing authority as also under Art. 310(1) of the Constitution. [451 H] (a) The State Government had no power to make the appointment to the post unless such power was conferred upon it by virtue of a direction given by the Central Government under s. 34, but there was no such direction, in the present case. The Central Government only empowered the State Government to nominate the person to be appointed to the post but the appointment of the person so nominated could only be made and, in fact, was made by the Central Government by its order dated 3rd September, 1955. [450 D-F] (b) The State Government's order dated 1st December, 1955 purporting to appoint the first dent was merely a formal appointment letter pursuant to the suggestion of the Central Government. It had-no legal consequence since by that the first respondent was already appointed to the post. [450 G] (c) Moreover, the post was sanctioned by the President of India and created by the Central Government and the whole of the expenditure in connection with it was to be home out of funds allocated by the Central Government. The State.
 Government's. order purporting to accord sanction to the creation of the post was only for the purpose of regularizing its own accounts procedure in disbursing the amount allocated by the Central Government. [450 H-451 B] (d) When the question regarding the issue of pay clip in favour of the first respondent for the period subsequent to 29th February, 1950, arose, the Accountant General of the State pointed out that the sanction to the continuance 445 of the post given by the State Government was meaningless and ineffective and it could not be acted upon until receipt of sanction to its continuancy from the Central Government.
 [451 C-D] Therefore, the Central Government, which was the appointing authority, could terminate the service of the first- respondent, under s. 6, General Clauses Act, 1897. [451 G] (e) There is no provision under which the State Government could have the power to determine the appointment as Assistant Settlement Commissioner made by the Central Government under s. 3. The person appointed would hold the post during the pleasure of the President and only the Central Government would be entitled to terminate it. [451 G-H] The High Court was, therefore, right in taking the view that the, order of the State Government dated April 17, 1956, was ineffectual and invalid and that the service of the first respondent was validly terminated only on February 18, 1959, by the Central Government.
