 The appellant, an employee of the Ministry of Commerce was tried for offences under s. 161 of the Indian Penal Code and s. 5(2) read with s. 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act on the allegation that he received a sum of money and some cloth from a trader. He was convicted and his appeal before the High Court failed. In appeal before this Court the questions that fell for determination related to : (i) the circumstances in which a presumption under sub-s. (1) of s. 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act could arise, and (ii) the nature of the burden of proof that lay on an accused person to rebut such a presumption when it arises.
 
HELD:(i) For a presumption to be raised under s. 4(1) it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove anything more than that money or other valuable thing was received by the accused; it is not for the prosecution, for the above purpose, to prove the incriminating character of the said payment.

 1964 S.C. 575 and C. I. Emden v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1959] INSC 154; A.I.R. 1960 S.C 548, followed.
 (ii)The burden of proof lying upon the accused under s.
 4(1) will be satisfied if the accused person establishes his case by a prepared of probability and it is not necessary that he should establish his case by the test of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The onus on an accused person may well be compared to the onus on a party in civil proceedings. [741 B] Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C.
 462, Rex v. Carr-Briant, [1943] 1 K.B. 607 and Harbhajan Singh v. Stale of Punjab, [1965] INSC 53; [1965] 3 S.C.R. 235, referred to.
 In the present case the appellant had not proved his case even by the test of preponderance of probability.
