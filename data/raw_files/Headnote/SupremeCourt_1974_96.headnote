 The above appeals were disposed of by this Court on 16-8-72.
 The court set aside the seniority list prepared by the Department on 15-7-68 and save directions as to how the same was to be prepared. This Court held that the Government's decision to promote a large number of Income Tax Officers from Class II to Class I infringed the quota rule which save 66-1/2 of the posts to the direct recruits and 331% of the posts to the promoters and therefore, the quota rule collapsed and it was for the Government to devise a just and fair seniority rule as between the direct recruits and the promoters for being given effect to from 16-1-1959. It followed from the judgment that the Government will prepare the seniority list from 1951 to 15-1-1959 in accordance with the quota rule of 1952 r/w the seniority rule 1(f) (iii).
 The seniority list from 16-1-1959 will be prepared in accordance with the rule to be freshly made by the Government in that behalf.
 Accordingly on February 9, 1973 the President under the proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution, made rules called the Income-tax Officers (Class 1) Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules 1973, which were to come into force from 16-1-1959. Rule 3 which provided for seniority of officers was that seniority among the promoters Inter se shall be determined In the order of selection for such promotion.
 The seniority among the direct recruits inter se shall be determined by the order of merit in which they are selected and the relative seniority among the promoters and the direct recruits shall be in the ratio 1 : 1 and shall be regulated in accordance with a roster maintained for the purpose etc.
 When the present seniority list was prepared Government had on its hands 73 promotees (Spill-over) who, though appointed earlier between 1956-1958, had no quota posts for their absorption. Therefore, the Government had to Prepare a new seniority list not only as regards the officers who were absorbed in the service before 15-1-1959 but all officers including these spill-overs, appointed after 15-1-1959. The seniority list from serial No. 1 to serial No. 485 (who were appointed prior to 15-1-1959) has been prepared in accordance with the quota system and serial No. 486 to 1717 related to officers who have to be accommodated from 16-1- 1959 in accordance with the new Seniority Rule. Since under Rule 3(iii), the promotee must come first, and then the direct recruit, serial No. 486 went to the promotee and serial No. 487 went to a direct recruit and so on.
 The contention of 73 spill-over promotees of 16-1-1959 was that since this Court had directed that they should be absorbed on a "priority basis", all of them should have been shown in the Seniority List, as having been appointed on 16- 1-1959 in a block and thereafter the direct recruits for that year should have been shown.
 It was further contended that as the quota rule expired on 16-1-1959, the promotees must be deemed to have been validly appointed in accordance with rule 4 of the Income-tax Officers (Class I) Grade 11 Service Recruitment Rules 1945 and since there remained in existence, no seniority or quota rule determining their seniority vis-a-vis the direct recruits, their natural seniority of earlier appointment cannot retrospectively be altered to their detriment, and to do so would be violative of Article 16 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the petitions and holding that the new seniority list is the correct seniority list.

HELD : (1) It is true that this Court had directed that the aforesaid 73 promotees should be absorbed on a "priority basis". That only meant that their position as seniors should not be prejudiced by any possible claim by later pro- motees, on the ground that being recruited outside the quota, they had higher rights than these 73 promotees who had no posts. It was not intended that these 73 promotees should not be governed by any seniority rule. They were to be governed by a rule which covered all those who came or were deemed to have come into the cadre after 15-1-1959.
 [109D-E] (2) The new Rules are not violative of Art. 16 of the Constitution. When the 73 spill-over appointments were made, there were no allocated posts to which the appointments could have been validly made. On 16-1-1959, there were no posts earmarked for them, the ordinary consequence of which would be to revert them to their original class II posts unless class I posts were regularly found for them. When the quota rule was no longer in existence there was no possibility of regularizing the appointments. It is, therefore, clear that the infir city in the appointments continued on 16-1-1959 and that infirmity could not be overcome except by a new rule. It is not correct to say that this infirmity disappeared with the disappearance of the quota rule. The spill-over promotees claim seniority from 16-1-1959 and the other promotees claim from some date between 1959 and 1962, when they were promoted, but this claim is untenable because all these officers were told when promoted that their appointments were on an officiating or ad hoc basis and the question of their seniority had not been determined. Therefore, they cannot contend that their dates of appointment in class I will not be altered for the purposes of determining seniority. There is no question in this case of any discrimination being made in a service after officers from two sources have been brought and absorbed in one cadre.
 The problem here is of integrating officers from two sources into one service by adjusting their seniority inter se.
