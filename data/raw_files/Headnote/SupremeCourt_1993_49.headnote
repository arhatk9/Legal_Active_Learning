 Respondent No. 4 was a tenant in a residential house owned by the appellants. He claimed that there was an agreement for sale of the property to him and in part performance thereof he continued in possession of the house and therefore he could not be evicted. An eviction suit riled appellants against Respondent No. 4 was decreed. In execution of the decree, the appellants were put in physical possession of the house with the aid of police force.
 Thereafter in a bid to take over possession of the said house, Respondent No. 4 opened fire and the appellants lodged FIR with the police. Proceedings under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was drawn up by the Sub- Divisional Magistrate. The proceeding ended in favour of the appellants, and Respondent No. 4 was restrained from entering upon the property. The Criminal Revision Petition preferred by Respondent No. 4 was dismissed by the High Court.
 Later, Respondent No. 4 again riled an application before the S.D.M. for initiating proceedings under section 145 Cr.
 P.C. and the same was dismissed. Since this order was not challenged, it became final.
 Thereafter Respondent No. 4 filed a Title Suit. He also filed an application under section 482 Cr.P.C. before the High Court claiming the same relief as was claimed before the S.D.M. The High Court in its judgment directed that the possession of the house shall be with the police till the disposal of the suit. The appellant's application for recalling the judgment was rejected by the High Court.
 Being aggrieved by the said 394 judgment, the appellants preferred the present appeals.
 Allowing the appeals, this Court, 
HELD : 1. The High Court failed to appreciate the crucial fact that the appellants were not put in possession of the property by the Sub Divisional Magistrate on the termination of the proceeding under Section 144 Cr.P.C. but had obtained actual physical possession thereof earlier in the execution of the eviction decree with police aid and the status quo was restored by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate while disposing of the proceeding under section 144 Cr.P.C. and dismissing the application of respondent No. 4 for starting a fresh proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. On the finding arrived at by him, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate took the right step in restoring the possession of the property to the appellants, who had been for a temporary period restrained from entering upon the same. The application made by respondent No.4 under section 482 Cr.P.C. was thus a gross abuse of the process of the Court. [396D-F] 
2. By virtue of an interim order of this Court the appellants have remained in possession of the house and they shall continue to do so until respondent No.4 obtains a decree in his favour in the pending suit and dispossesses the appellants in accordance with law. [396G]
