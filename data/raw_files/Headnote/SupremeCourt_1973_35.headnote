The sons did not withdraw any amount from their accounts in the firm and the amounts continued to be invested in the firm for which interest at 7 1/22% per annum was paid to them.

 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : Neither the property gifted to the donees nor the amount of Rs. 1 lakh, gifted to the five sons could be included in the estate of the deceased. [81A-B] Section 10 consists of two conditions, namely, (1) the donee must bona fide have assumed possession 'and enjoyment of the property which is the subject matter of the gift to the exclusion of the donor immediately upon the gift and (2) the donee must have retained such possession and enjoyment of the property to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise; and unless both are satisfied the property would be liable to Estate duty.
 The second part of the section has two limbs, namely, the deceased must be entirely excluded,, (a) from the property, and (b) from any benefit by contract or otherwise. The word "otherwise" must be construed ejusdem generis and it must be interpreted to mean some kind of legal obligation or some transaction enforceable at law. or in equity, which, though not in the form of a contract, may confer a benefit on the donor. [557 F-H. 558A-C] In the present case, the first two conditions are satisfied because of the unequivocal transfer of the properties and the last limb of the condition relating to any benefit to the donor by contract or otherwise is inapplicable. The donor, on the date when he gifted the property which was leased out to the firm, had two rights, namely, ownership in the property and right to terminate the tenancy and obtain posses- 555 (Jaganmohan Reddy, J.) sign thereof. He has transferred the ownership and has given such possession as the circumstances and the nature of the property admit. It could not be said that since the donor was a partner in the firm which had taken the property on lease, he derived benefit therefrom and was therefore not entirely excluded from the possession and enjoyment thereof The benefit the donor had as a member of the partnership was not a benefit referable in any way to the gift but is unconnected therewith.
