 The appellants were a firm of building contractors and were registered as dealers under the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax, 1959. They were purchasing building materials, which were taxable under the Art, and were using them in the course of their business. The Sales-tax Officer served notices upon them under s. 18(5) calling upon them to show cause why best judgment assessment should not be made. The appellants did not offer any explanation for their failure to submit returns of their turnover, and the Sales-tax Officer assessed their turnover in respect of sales as nil and assessed them to Purchase-tax under s. 7 in respect of goods purchased by them for use in their construction business. Rule 33 of the, Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Rules, 1959, provides that a notice of assessment under s.
 18(5) shall not give, ordinarily, less than 15 days from the date of the service to show cause, but, the notices in the present case did not give the appellants a clear period of 15 days to show cause.
 On the questions: (1) Whether the notices were invalid, and therefore, the assessment, on the basis of those notices was bad in law; (2) Whether the appellants were dealers; and (3) Whether the imposition of purchase-tax under s. 7 was in order, HELD:(1) The terms of r. 33 are not mandatory.
 Therefore, unless prejudice has resulted to the tax-payer the proceedings are not liable to be set aside. In the instant case it was not the case of the appellants that because of the insufficiency of time they were unable to submit their explanation. Hence, the notice and valid. [492 E-F; 493 B] M/s.

 (2)Whether in a particular set of circumstances a person may be said to be a dealer carrying on business in a commodity must depend upon the 'facts of that case and no general test may be applied for determining the question.
 Merely because the turnover of the appellants in respect of sales was nil they did not cease to be dealers. A person, to be a dealer within the meaning of the Act, need not both purchase and sell goods because, a person who carries on the business of buying is, by the definition of the term in s.
 2(d), a dealer. [403 H; 496 F] State of A.P. v. H. Abdul Bakshi, 15 S.T.C. 644 (&C.) followed.

 (3)By using the expression 'either consumers such goods in the manufacture of the goods for sale or otherwise' in s. 7, the Legislature intended that consumption of goods Tenders the price paid for their purchase, taxable, if the goods are used in the manufacture of the goods for sale, or if the goods are consumed otherwise. Therefore, under s. 7, purchase tax is Payable. where no sales-tax is payable under s. 6 on the sale price of the good, by a dealer who buys taxable goods in the course of hi% business, and, (a) either consumes such goods in the manufacturer of other goods for sale; or (b) consumes such goods otherwise; or (c) dis- poses of such goods in any manner other than by way of sale in the State; or (d) despatches them to a place outside the State except as a, direct result of sale or purchase in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. In the present case the assessees were registered as dealers, they had purchased taxable material in the course of their business and had, consumed the materials otherwise than in the manufacture of goods for sale and for a profit motive.
 Therefore, the purchase price paid by the appellant was taxable. [495 E-G; 496 A-B] Y.K. S. V. Sangh v. State of Maharashtra, 22 S.T.C. 116, not applicable.
