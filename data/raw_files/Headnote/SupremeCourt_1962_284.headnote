 The Deputy Commercial Tax Officer imposed sales tax under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, on the respondent for the assessment year and the appeal taken against the assessment order was dismissed. Thereafter the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes issued a notice proposing to determine the escaped turnover for the period of assessment and in pursuance of this notice he determined the revised turnover. On the dismissal of the appeal filed by the respondent before the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal lie filed a revision petition before the High Court. The High Court allowed the revision petition on the ground that the notice by the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes was issued without jurisdiction.
 The State appealed to the Supreme Court with special leave.
 The main questions in the appeal were whether the notice was issued without jurisdiction and whether the rules under which the notice was issued were ultra vires the Act.
 Held, that the power of the Deputy Commissioner to assess escaped turnover under r. 17 (3A) framed under s. 19 of the Act does not arise out of the revisional jurisdiction exercised tinder s. 12 (2) of the Act. The Deputy Commissioner is therefore not bound to restrict himself to the examination of the 564 evidence already on record. Section 9 does not deal with escaped turnover but is a provision for determination of the turnover of a dealer in the first instance. Rule 17 deals with a separate and independent jurisdiction in regard to determining and taxing escaped turnovers. There is no conflict between s. 12 (2) and rr. 17 (1), 17 (IA) and 17 (3A). Therefore the notice was not issued without jurisdiction, nor was r. 17 (1) vires the substantive provisions of the Act.
