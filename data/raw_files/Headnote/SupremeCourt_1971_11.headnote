 The Collector of Customs and Excise confiscated certain smuggled goods. and levied a personal penalty of Rs. 20,0,00 on the appellant under s. 112 of the Customs Act, 1962. He filed an appeal under s. 128 before the first respondent and pleaded that the deposit of penalty as required by s.
 129 may be waived. The first respondent, after hearing him on the preliminary point regarding waiver of deposit of penalty ordered that the appeal would be heard on merits if a sum of Rs. 10,000 out of the total penalty was deposited by the appellant; but, since the appellant failed to deposit even the amount of Rs. 10,000 within the prescribed period, the appeal was rejected. The appellant carried the matter in revision to the Government. He was given a further opportunity to deposit the sum of Rs. 10,000 but as he again failed to do so, the revision petition was rejected. A writ petition to quash the orders of the first respondent and the Government was dismissed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Section 129(1) makes it obligatory on the person faling an appeal to deposit the penalty levied pending the disposal of the appeal on merits. The proviso to the section gives power to the Appellate Authority, in appropriate cases, to dispense with such deposit unconditionally or subject to such conditions as it may deem fit. Even though the section, does not expressly provide for the rejection of the appeal for non-compliance with the requirements regarding deposit or with any order that may be passed under the proviso, the Appellate Authority is competent to reject the appeal in those circumstances.
 Otherwise, the appeal will have to be kept on file and such retention will serve no purpose, because, the Appellate Authority cannot dispose of the appeal on merits when the requirements of s. 129(1) are not complied with. [362 F-G;
 364 A-C] (2) The rejection of the appeal and revision would mean that the appellant was bound by the order of the Collector, but that result was brought about only by the appellant's default. [364 D-E]
