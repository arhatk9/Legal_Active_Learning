 Dismissing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. The clear words of the detention order show that the detaining authority was alive to the fact that the petitioners were in jail custody on the date of passing of the detention orders, but it was satisfied that if they were enlarged on bail, of which there was every likelihood, they would create problems of public order and, therefore, it was necessary to prevent them from doing so. The position would have been entirely different if the petitioners were in jail and had to remain in jail for a pretty long time, in which situation there could be no apprehension of breach of public order from them. [944 C-E] 
 2. Preventive detention is an anticipatory measure and does not relate to an offence while the criminal proceedings are to punish a person for an offence committed by him. They are not parallel proceedings. In the circumstances the pendency of a criminal prosecution is no bar to an order of preventive detention, nor is an order of preventive detention a bar to prosecution. It is for the detaining authority to have the subjective satisfaction whether in such a case there are sufficient materials to place the person under preventive detention in order to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to public order or the like in future. [944 F-H] K.M. Chokshi v. State of Gujarat, [1979] INSC 122; [1979] 4 SCC 14, applied.
 3.1. The difference between 'law and order' and 'Public order' is now well settled. Applying the well settled law enunciated in Ram Ranjan Chatterjee 940 v. The State of West Bengal, [1975]3 SCR 301, to the two incidents, it is clear that throwing a bomb in a large gathering where a cultural programme was going on at the dead of night resulting in the public running helter and skelter to save their lives makes out a case of 'public order' inasmuch as it disturbed the tranquillity and the even tempo of life of the public. Therefore, if the detaining authority was satisfied that the two incidents make out a case of apprehension of breach of public order, the detention order cannot be faulted. [945 G; 946 E-G] Ram Ranjan Chaterjee v. State of West Bengal, [1975] INSC 12; [1975] 3 S.C.R. 301 followed.
 Saya Mala v. Home Secretary, Government of J & K, AIR 1982 SC. 1297, distinguished.
 3:2. The two incidents in the instant case were sufficient for the detaining authority to initiate proceedings for preventive detention. It is for the detaining authority to have the subjective satisfaction about the apprehension of the breach of public order from the incidents. Even one incident may be sufficient to satisfy the detaining authority. It all depends upon the nature of the incident. [947 G-H] 
 4. The absence of an allegation about the disturbance of public order in the two First Information Reports will not affect the position because there was additional material before the detaining authority which satisfied him about the apprehension of breach of public order from the petitioners in case they were enlarged on bail. [948 C-D]
