 Respondent No. 1 was officiating as Deputy Engineer from May 16, 1955 to December 3, 1959 in the P.W.D. of the then State of Bombay. Thereafter, he was selected by competitive examination and appointed to a post in B.S.F. Class-11 Service. Under the Engineering Service Rules, 1960, a direct recruit is required to undergo training for one year and thereafter to work on probation for another year as in- charge of a sub-division. Since respondent No. 1 had already worked as officiating Deputy Engineer, the initial period of one year's training was dispensed with and he was directly placed in-charge of a subdivision. After completion of 2 years, he was confirmed as Deputy Engineer in Class-11 from December 3, 1961.
 In June 1961. the Committee appointed to prepare t select list of Deputy Engineers for promotion as officiating Executive Engineers, did not consider respondent No. 1 for promotion because he had not put in 7 years (reduced to 6 years in 1961) service requisite under rule 7(ii) for such promotion. The Government's stand was that the service rendered by the direct recruits prior to their appointment to Class-11 could not be taken into account in computing their eligibility service of 7 years. The case of respondent no. 1 was that under the Rules, his pre- selection service (from 16-5-1955 to 2-12-1959), must be tacked on to his past-selection service for calculating the requisite period of his eligibility service.
 In the case of respondents Nos. 2 and 3 also. the Government did not count the period of their pre-selection service for the purpose of their eligibility services and hence the dispute.
 The High Court found that the differentiation made by the Government in the application of the rules, had no reasonable nexus with the object of promotion and the action of the Government was discriminatory and so violative of Art. 16 of the Constitution. On appeal, the question for consideration was whether the action of the State Government in treating 'differently' the promoters and direct recruits in Class-11 for the purpose of computing the period of their eligibility service requisite for promotion as officiating Executive Engineers, violates the constitutional guarantee of equal treatment enshrined in Art. 16 of the Constitution.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD (i) It is manifest that direct recruits and promotees in class constitute two distinct groups or classes. This classification has a historical background and a rational basis. The promotees from the lower ranks have only one chance of getting into Class-11 service, as against three available to the direct recruits. Further, for a considerable time, recruitment by promotion from the ranks of temporary officiating Deputy Engineers etc., to Class-11 service remained frozen with consequent stagnation and loss of incentive in the service' At the time of their entry into Class-11 service, the promotees are, broadly speaking, far older than the direct recruits, and many of the promotees may have less than 7 years to go before attaining the age of superannuation. If in the case of both these groups of promotees and direct recruits with different backgrounds and dissimilar circumstances, the period of 7 years eligibility service were to start from the date of their absorption in Class-III then for most of the promotees, there would be a rare chance of ever getting promotion as officiating Executive Engineers. The classification is thus based on intelligible differential.
 256 (ii)If a person, like any of the respondents, to avoid the long tortuous wait leave his position in the "never ending" queue of temporary officiating Deputy Engineers etc., looking for promotion and takes a short-cut through the direct channel to Class 11 service he gives up once for all, the advantages and disadvantages that go with the channel of promotion and accepts all the handicaps and benefits which attach to the group of direct recruits. He cannot, after his direct recruitment, claim the benefit of his pre- selection service and thus have best of both the worlds. It is well settled that so long as the classification is reasonable and the persons falling in the same class are treated alike, there is no question of violation of the constitutional guarantee of equal treatment. [261D] Gangaram v. Union of India, [1970] INSC 10; [1970] 3 S.C.R. 481, referred to.
 (iii) The select list is prepared on the basis of 'seniority-cum-merit' and the inter-se seniority of the selected officers in the lower ranks is ordinarily to be maintained in the promoted ranks. Acceptance of the respondent's contention will make the smooth working and uniform application of this principle of seniority-cummerit difficult. The inter-se seniority of the selected officers will be seriously disturbed and the Department will be faced with the anomalous situation of ajunior officer, with pre- selection service, becoming eligible to be considered for promotion over the head of his seniors. even in the same group, havingno such fortuitous pre-selection service to their credit. There is nothing inrule 7(ii) which compels the interpretation that in the case of direct recruits also.
 their pre-selection service as officiating Deputy Engineers, if any, should be counted towards their "eligibility service". Such an interpretation would create two classes even amongst direct recruits and thus result in inequality of treatment rather than in removing it. Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that the respondents possessed the required length of service in Class-11 to be entitled to promotion along with others. [262C] Prabhakar Yeshwant Joshi v. State of Maharashtra, [1970] 2 S.C. referred to.
