 The appellant, an Assistant in the P.W.D. office was appointed on 10-2-72 against a tenure post of a Legal Assistant in the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Karnal on an "ad hoc" basis. Finding him unsuitable to the post, on an assessment of his work, he was reverted to his parent office on 27-4-72. The order of reversion was challenged as violative of Art. 311 of the Constitution by a Writ Petition, which was dismissed "in limine".
 On an appeal by special leave the Court ^ 
 HELD : (i) Whether the appointment, was "ad hoc" or temporary the appellant had no right to the post from which he was reverted. [186F] (ii) The order was not meant as a measure of punishment as it was passed on the ground of unsuitability to the post.
 [186 G] (iii) Where an order of reversion, of a person who had no right to the post does not show "ex-facie" that he was being reverted as a measure of punishment or does not cast any stigma on him, the courts will not normally go behind that order to see, if there were any motivating factors behind that order. [187 D] OBITER :
 The theory whether the reversion to a lower post, of a probationer in a higher post or the discharge of a probationer the temporary servant, was meant as a punishment leads to a very peculiar situation and the whole position in law is rather confusing. It is time that the whole question was considered "de novo" and it would be better for all concerned to avoid litigation if it should be held that the reversion of a probationer from a higher to a lower post or the discharge of a probationer or the discharge from service of a temporary servant cannot be questioned except on the basis of "mala fide" in the making of the order.
