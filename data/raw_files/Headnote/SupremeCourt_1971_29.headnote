 From March 1960 to January 1962 entertainment duty, was levied on the appellants at the rates, prescribed in s. 3 of the Bombay Entertainment Duty Act, 1923, on the net pi-ice receivable by the proprietor of a theatre and not on the total amount including entertainment duty collected from visitors. Thereafter entertainment duty was levied on the aggregate of the net value of the ticket and duty paid by the visitors.The appellants challenged the validity of the levy but the High Court dismissed their petition.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) By s. 3 of the Act duty is leviable at therates prescribed on all payments for admission and the method of levy isprescribed by s. 4.Under s. 4(1) on the ticket for admission to any entertainment, an impressed, embossed, engraved or adhesive stamp issued by the State Government of the value specified in s. 3 must be affixed. The definition of 'payment for admission' in s. 2(b) includes payment for any purpose whatsoever connected with an entertainment which a person is required to make as a condition of attending or continuing to attend the entertainment. The price which the visitor pays for a ticket for admission to the entertainment is thus the value of the stamp affixed and the net value of the ticket, and the proprietor of the theatre is therefore liable to pay entertainment duty on the gross sum received from a visitor, [402 E, H; 403 A-B; 404 D] (2)The use of the expression "affixed to it a stamp of the value of the duty payable out of the said price of admission" "in rule 7 of the rules framed under the Act does not support the view that the amount of entertainment duty represented by the ticket alone is payable by the proprietor. It only means that the proprietor shall specify on the ticket the amountchargeable by him to the visitor. [403 F-G] (3) The proprietor thus passes on a part of the duty payable by him to the visitor but he does not act as an agent of the Government for collecting the duty, because, tinder ss. 3 and 4 the liability for payment of the duty is imposed upon the proprietor and not upon the visitors to the theatre. [402 H; 403 B] (4)A proprietor paying entertainment duty on the total amount received by him 'from the visitor will never be able to collect the full amount of entertainment duty from such visitor. A part of the duty payable by him will have to come out of the amount received by him as the net charge for a ticket. \But-questions of hardship cannot justify a departure from the provisions of ss. 3 and 4 of the Act, The Legislature must be deemed to have contemplated that only a part of the entertainment duty levied by the Government must be collected from the visitors to the theatre and the balance should be paid by the proprietor. [4O4 F-H] 399 (5)But the Act contains no provision for reopening assessments already made and the State cannot therefore reopen the concluded assessments prior to January 1962. [405 B]
