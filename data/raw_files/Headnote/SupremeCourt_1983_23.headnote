 The Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 envisages the setting up of Trusts and the Trusts so set up were to be bodies corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. The duties and functions entrusted to the Trusts included, among others, preparation of schemes for improvement and expansion of towns in the State. For the purpose of manning the senior posts under tho Trusts, the Act conferred power on the State Government to constitute certain services. One of the services constituted by the Government was the Punjab Service of Trust Executive officers. Exercising power under the Act the State Government framed the Punjab Trust Services (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1978, The Rules envisaged the setting up of a Selection Committee called the Punjab Trust Services Selection Committee for selecting officers. After following the procedure prescribed under the Rules, the Selection Committee recommended the appointment of the eleven petitioners herein to the posts of Trust Executive officers, Class 1, II and II[. The Slate Government accepted the recommendations of the Selection Committee and in May, 1979 appointed the petitioners to the respective posts.
 Condition (c) of the terms and conditions annexed to the order of appointment issued to each of the appointees stated: "All the appointees shall remain on probation for a period of one year under rule 10(1) of the Rules. The regular appointments shall be subject to the satisfactory completion of the period of probation by such appointee after the expiry of one year & on the date of his joining on the completion of one year of service an increment was released in favour of each of the appointees.
 In August, 1980 tho State Government dissolved 21 Trusts. Purporting to act under rule 9 of the 1978 Rules, the Governor dispensed with immediate effect the services of each of the 11 petitioners after paying a month's salary in lieu of a month's notice.
 518 In their petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution impugning the order of the State Government dispensing with their services! the petitioners alleged that after they had satisfactorily completed the period of probation of one year it was not open to tho State Government to dispense with their services; the power to dissolve the Trusts was used by the Government to get rid of the petitioners; that sometime after dispensing with their services the Trusts had been reconstituted but even so they had not been recalled to their posts and that the action of the Government in the case was thoroughly arbitrary, actuated by extraneous considerations.
 In reply it was stated that under rule 9 (2) the State Government had power to dispense with the services of a probationer if his work and conduct during the period of probation were not satisfactory; payment of a month's pay in lieu of notice was made by way of abundant caution and that it could not confer any right on the petitioners; the period of probation of one year, mentioned in clause (c) of the annexure to the order of appointment was a typographical-cum clerical error, which in terms of rule 9 (2) should have been two years in respect of direct recruits and lastly their services had been dispensed with because with the dissolution of the Trusts the Executive officers had become surplus and their continuance in service would be an avoidable burden on the exchequer.
 It was contended on behalf of the State Government that the expression 'shall' in rule 9 (I ) on its own force would apply so that the direct recruits would automatically be on probation for a period of two years and no power or discre- tion is conferred on anyone to reduce this period.

 HELD: It is not necessary to prescribe a period of probation and the State Government as the appointing authority would have discretion in the matter subject to rules by which the appointment is governed. [529 C] Under the archaic law of hire and fire the concept of probation in service jurisprudence was practically absent;
 but with the advent of the concept of security in public service it came to acquire a certain connotation. In order that an incompetent or inefficient servant is not foisted upon the master the concept of probation was devised. A new recruit is put on test for a period before be is absorbed in the service or has acquired a right to the post. In so far as the master is concerned the period of probation gave a sort of locus pententaie to him to observe the work, ability, efficiency, sincerity and competence of the servant and if the servant is not found suitable for the post the master reserved the right to dispense with his service during or at the end of the period of probation. The period of probation, therefore, furnished a valuable opportunity to the master to closely observe the work of a probationer. The termination of service of a probationer during or at the and of the probation did not ordinarily and by itself constitute a punishment for, the servant had no right to continue to hold such a post. The period of probation may vary from post to post or from master to master. It is not obligatory on the part of the master to prescribe a period of probation;
 it is open to him to employ a person without putting him on probation. In short the power to keep a servant on probation and the period during which his performance is to be observed remained tho prerogative of the master.

 There is no general rule which may help in determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory. It is the duty of the court to try to get at the real intention of the Legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be construed. The use of the expression 'shall' is not decisive and the question whether a provision is mandatory or directory depends upon the intent of the Legislature and not upon the language in which the intent is clothed.

 State of U.P. & Ors. v. Babu Ram Upadhaya, [1960] INSC 229; [1961] 2 SCR 679 at 710; State of U.P. v. Manbodhan Lal Srivastava, [1958] 2 SCR 533 and Montreal Street Railway Company v. Normandin, L.R. [1917] A.C. 170, referred to.
 Rule 9 (2) is directory and confers a discretion on the State Government to prescribe a period of probation shorter than the maximum set out in it. The period of two years prescribed in this rule is the maximum period which means that the rule placed an embargo on the appointing authority's right to prescribe a period of probation longer than two years. But the rule does not admit of a construction that a period shorter than two years could not be prescribed. The rule enables the appointing authority to determine the suitability of the person appointed and the State Government may, having regard to the biodata and other information it has about the officers, feel that a period shorter than two years would suffice to make up its mind whether to retain him in service or to dispense with his service. Power in this respect is vested in the State Government which is the highest authority and that power has to be exercised on the recommendation of a statutory body.
 This power is not taken away by the use of the expression 'shall' in the rule. [527 C-F] In the instant case two of the petitioners who were appointed to class I post possessed high educational qualifications, had considerable experience in the education department of the State and left the permanent service under the State to take up the present jobs. Persons of such long experience and high qualifications would be disinclined to be put on probation again for a period of two years. It is therefore reasonable to infer that, having regard to the high attainments of tho candidates, the State Government had prescribed a period of probation of one year. A few other petitioners, who were appointed to class II and Ill posts were practising advocates. In all the cases, on the completion of the period of probation of one year they were given an increment which is released only if the work and conduct of the person are found to be satisfactory. It is implicit in this that they bad satisfactorily discharged their duties during the period of probation. In the face of this position to hold that the wording of the appointment order stating that each of the appointees would be on probation for one year was a typographical-cum-clerical error, would be doing violence to commonsense.
 [525 B-E, 529 C-F] That the dissolution of the Trusts was a device to get rid of tho petitioners is evident from later events. By the very order by which the Trusts were dissolved certain officers were appointed to carry on the functions of the Trusts. Therefore the Trusts, independent of the Board of Trustees, had a corporate personality, with a perpetual succession and their functions had to be carried out. The 520 effect of the dissolution was me rely to dissolve the Board of Trustees. The corporate personality of the Trust remained inviolate. If the Trusts were functioning, if their schemes were being implemented, if all other staff was retained there is no substance in the contention that the services of the petitioners alone were no longer required because of the dissolution of Trusts. Even if the charge of mala fide is not true there are certain aspects which unerringly point in the direction that the action was arbitrary and is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. [535 A-E] There is equally no force in the contention that after the dissolution of the Trusts their continued retention in service was imposing an unnecessary burden on the State exchequer. After removing the petitioners 11 other officers were asked to take over their duties. This apart, the State exchequer was not responsible for the salary and prequisites of the Trust Executive officers; their salaries, allowances and prequisites were charged on the fund of the Trusts as envisaged by section 17 (4) of the Act. [534 A] The argument that the performance of the petitioners was not satisfactory is equally untenable. On the expiry of the period of probation they were allowed an increment and were continued in service. It would be unjust to say that their work was unsatisfactory till they earned their increments but that their work and ) conduct were found to be unsatisfactory within less than six weeks thereafter, meriting dispensing with their services.
