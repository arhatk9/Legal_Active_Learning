 Disciplinary proceedings were started against the appellant, a Deputy Tahsildar, and three of his subordinates on charge of accepting illegal gratification. On May 20, 1949, he was placed under suspension and relieved of his duties. The Disciplinary Proceedings Tribunal directed the consolidation and common hearing of the enquiries against the, appellant and the other three civil servants. Although the Tribunal refused an earlier application of the appellant for permission to engage counsel, at the hearing of the enquiry on being told that he could engage the same counsel who appeared for the other three civil servants, the appellant engaged that counsel and was represented by him throughout the enquiry. The, Tribunal declined to grant a prayer of the appellant on June 13, 1949, to grant an adjournment of the hearing and the enquiry was held on June 13, 14 and 15.
 Upon the Tribunal recommending the appellants dismissal and after He had been served with a show cause notice and had replied thereto, on October 17, 1950, the Government directed, that he be dismissed from service with effect from May 20, 1949;.
 The appellant then instituted a suit and sought a declaration that the, order dated October 17, 1950 was illegal and void. The trial court dismissed the suit and this decision was affirmed on appeal by the High. court.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that in view of the, refusal of the appellant's prayer to engage counsel of his own choice and of his prayer for adjournment on June 13, he had been denied a reasonable opportunity to defend himself against the charges; and furthermore, that the order of dismissal dated October 17, 1950 having been passed with retrospective effect from the date of suspension was illegal and in-operative.
 
HELD : (i) The appellant had been given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself against the charges. [206 D] There was no conflict of interests between the appellant and the other three civil servants; there was nothing to show that the, counsel representing the other three was unable to conduct the appellant's defence properly. [206 C] (ii) The order of dismissal as from October 17, 1950, was valid and effective. [207 A] An order of dismissal with retrospective effect is, in substance, an order of dismissal as from the date of the order- with the superadded direction that the order should operate as from an; anterior date. The 205 two parts of the order are clearly severable. Assuming that the second part of the order is invalid, there is no reason why the. first part of the order should not be given the fullest effect. [207 G-H; 208 Al Hemanta Kumar v. S. N.
