 The definition of the word "purchase" was first introduced in the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948, in 1958. As the rate of tax to be levied was to be contained in a Notification to be issued under s. 5(1) of the, Act, a Notification was issued in April 1958 regarding the rate. of tax on the purchase of goods "for use in the manufacture of good,% for -.is per the then definition of "purchase". The definition of "purchase" was amended twice in 1959 and again by Punjab Act 19 of 1960. The definition after these amendments has reference to the goods specified in Schedule C to the Act an item of which relates to cotton, and, after the 1960 amendment the clause "for use in the manufacture of goods for sale" was omitted. After those amendments, no fresh Notification prescribing the rate of tax on the purchase of goods was issued till September 26, 1961.
 The appellant was a cotton ginning factory and was a dealer registered tinder the Act. Under s. 10, it had to send quarterly returns within the time specified and when sending the returns had to pay the amount of tax, in accordance with the returns which should also show the gross turnover.
 Failure to do so was an offence and subjected the dealer to heavy penalties. The appellant filed returns for the assessment years 1960-61, 1961-62) and 1962-63 and paid certain amounts of tax which, according to it were due from it. The assessing authority passed order of assessment, including in the appellant's turnover the amounts repre- senting the purchases of cotton made by the appellant for each of the years. The appellant thereupon filed writ petitions challenging the three assessment orders on the ground that the -second proviso to s. 5(1) and s.
 5(1)(a)(vi) of the Act, enabling the State to collect purchase tax in respect of cotton, were opposed to s. 15(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 and that, in consequence, it was not liable to pay any purchase tax far the assessment years in respect of cotton. The High Court rejected the petitions.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) (By Full Court) As no fresh Notification was issued till September 26, 1961, the orders of' assessment for the two years 1960-61 and 1961-62 could not be sustained. [592 H; 593 B] The levy of tax could not be sustained under the Notification of 1958 on the basis of s. 22 of the Punjab General Clauses Act. That section has no application, because the definition of "purchase" on the of Sup CI/67-7 578 which that Notification was issued is inconsistent with the definition of "purchase" as it stood after its amendment in 1960. [592E-F] Further, if the levy is to be sustained on the basis of the Notification of 1958, the State could levy tax only on the category of purchases "for use in the manufacture of goods for sale". But it was not open to the State to make such a choice. [592G] (2) (Per Subba Rao, C.J., Shah and Vaidialingam, JJ.) Even though there was a notification fixing the rate of tax for the year 1962-63, the order of assessment for that year and also for the two years 1960-61 and 1961-62 should be quashed on the ground that the provisions of the State law under which they were made violated s. 15 of the Central Act.
 [591A] Under s. 15(a) of the Central Act in respect of commodities like cotton which come under the category of "declared goods" is defined in s. 2(c) of the Central Act, the purchase tax can be levied only at one stage. The essence of one-stage taxation consists of fixation of a single point or stage, either by the State Act or the rules framed thereunder. A mere injunction by the Legislature, as contained in the second proviso to S. 5(1) of the State Act, that the rate should not be higher than the one fixed in the Central Act, and that the levy must be at one stage as men- tioned in the Central Act, will he of no avail, unless the Act or the rules framed under it make it clear that them will be no levy or collection of lax, except from the persons who are bound to pay as per the Central Act. The proviso doe,-, not serve any material purpose. because, even if it did not exist the authorities cannot levy tax on declared goods at a rate higher than that laid down in the Central Act. [583H- 584G-H; 587F-H. 588] Further, there can be no legal liability for payment of tax unless the Act or the rules prescribe a single point for taxation; but under s. 5(2)(a), in respect of the same item of declared goods, more than one person is made liable to pay tax. and the tax is levied at more than one stage. For example, if A sells declared goods to B and B to C, (B and C being registered dealers) and the sales are beyond the period of 6 months mentioned in s. 5(2) (a) (vi), both A and B will be liable to pay purchase tax. [588A-B, G-H] Moreover, in the final return sent by the dealer, it will have to show in the taxable turnover all purchases of cotton effected by it during the accounting year and the tax payable will have to be paid. The dealer can get a declaration from the dealer to whom the goods are re-sold and claim exemption under s. 5(2) (a) (vi) and r. 27A of the rules made under the Act. But these provisions apply only to registered dealers, whereas s. 15 of the Central Act is not restricted to registered dealers. Also, if a non- registered dealer intervenes, there is no machinery by which the dealer can ascertain whether his vendor of the declared good,-,, has paid the tax already. [584B; 588B-D, G] The orders of assessment could not be sustained on the basis of the provisions for refund in s. 12 and the rules. These provisions do not afford adequate relief. If the Central Act makes it mandatory that the tax can be collected only at one stage it is not enough for the State to say that a person who is not liable to pay tax, must nevertheless pay it in the first instance and then claim refund at a later stage. If a person is not liable for payment of tax at all, at any time, the collection of a tax from him with a possible contingency of refund at a later stage will not make the original levy valid. Besides. even in the matter of obtaining refunds the appellant will have to place before the officer concerned, particulars of transactions connected with the commodity and the basis on which it claims relief, and it would be extremely difficult to collect the materials in this behalf, because, there is no provision in the Act or the rules on the basis of which it will be entitled to be supplied with such relevant materials.

 (Per Sikri and Ramaswami, JJ. dissenting) :
 The assessment for the year 1962-63 is valid.
 The second proviso to s. 5 serves one useful purpose, namely, it gives immunity to the State Act from challenge on the ground that its provisions infringe s. 15 of the Central Act. The State Act is good and in -effect complies with the requirements of s. 15 of the Central Act, because, it is possible to find out the stage at which purchase tax become- leviable on goods mentioned in Schedule C, both in cases where the purchasers are registered dealers and in cases where unregistered dealers intervene. Under ss. 4 and 5 of the Act the stage is the first purchase which is not exempt from taxation or which is not deductible from the taxable turnover of a dealer under s. 5(2) of the State Act. For example, if A buys cotton and sells it to B and B sells to C, where all are registered dealers, if A is liable to pay purchase tax, B and C could say to the assessing authority that they are exempt from paying purchase tax. Since A would be interested in obtaining the declaration from B for claiming exemption under s. 5 (2) (a) (vi) and B would be interested in knowing whether A's was the first taxable purchase, they will behave like ordinary businessmen and know the true position is to whether A was liable or not.
 If A's sale was within and B's sale beyond, the period of 6 months mentioned in s. 5(2)(a)(vi), B will be liable to pay purchase tax and the purchaser from him would be exempt. If in the illustration C is an unregistered dealer, B will 'be liable to pay purchase tax because he cannot claim exemption under s. 5(2)(a)(vi). If B is also an unregistered dealer, B would be liable and C would be exempt. If B is an unregistered dealer, and C is a registered dealer, B will be liable unless he obtains the prescribed declaration from C.
 But if there is double taxation due to mischance in the case of registered dealer,, or ignorance in the case of unregistered dealers, the Act cannot be treated and void for that reason especially when there is a suitable provision for refund.
