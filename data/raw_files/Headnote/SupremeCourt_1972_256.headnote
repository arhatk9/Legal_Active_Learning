 The respondents,landlord lessors, had executed a lease on 9-11-1949. Under its terms, thelessors had given some land to the lessees for the building and rentingout of a cinema house for a period of twenty years. Clause 6 of the lease laid down that on the expiry of the tenancy the entire structure built by the lessees at their cost would become the property of the lessor who shall then exercise all the rights of ownership, subject to the condition that the lessor shall have to pay 50% of the market value of the structure to the lessees. If there was disagreement about the market value the same would be decided by arbitration.
 There was provision for sale of the structure in case the lessors failed to pay to the lessees within a fixed period 50% of market value of the structure assessed by arbitration, and that the lessees would have the first charge on the sale proceeds. On the expiry of the lease, the lessors applied under section 13(2) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act 3 of 1949, to the Rent Controller, for the eviction of the former tenant and the appellant sub-tenant. During the pendency of this application the lessees applied to the Rent Controller under s. 34 of the Indian Arbitration Act, for the stay of eviction proceedings pending the decision of a dispute between the parties as to who was entitled to possession while the market value was being determined by Arbitrators under clause 6 of the lease. The Rent Controller held, inter alia that the powers of ejectment under s.13 of the Act, on specified grounds, could not be curtailed even by some agreement between the parties and dismissed the stay application. The High Court dismissed the lessee's appeal under s. 39 of the Arbitration Act, after interpreting the lease deed and holding that clause 6 of the deed ",negatives any right in the lessees to retain possession after the expiry of the lease." In appeal by special leave before this court it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the High Court had not taken into account the fact that the cinema had necessarily to be run by somebody while the market value of the property was being ascertained by resort to arbitration. The respondents, inter alia, relied on s. 108 of the Transfer of Property Act which lays down that in the absence of a contract or usage to the contrary, the lessee is, on the determination of the lease, bound to put the lessor into possession of the property. Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : There is no provision in the lease expressly laying down that the right to obtain possession will be postponed, after the expiry of the term of the lease, until the ascertainment of the market value of the building has taken place. On the other hand the clause relied upon by the respondents not only lays down that the super-structure will become the property of the lessor on the expiry of the period of tenancy, but 678 goes on to specify that the lessor 'shall' then exercise all the rights of ownership including the right to sell the entire property. It is apparent that the exercise of all rights of ownership according to the terms of the clause, literally interpreted, could take place on the expiry of the tenancy immediately.
 The contention that the lessor's rights were subject to the payment of 50% of the market value of the building could not be accepted. If this had really been the intention of the parties, there was nothing to prevent them from inserting such a term in the deed so as to make that intention explicit. The more natural construction of the clause is that rights of ownership, including the right to take possession of the building, would become vested in the lessor at the expiry of the period of lease, and that 50% of the market value of the building, which was to be paid in any case, became a condition attached to this ownership of the building when it vested in the lessee. In view of s.108(q) of the Transfer of Property Act the burden of proving 'a contract to the contrary' was on the lessee; and, something to indicate an agreement to the contrary should be there on such a matter involving a valuable right, before this burden could be held to have been discharged. [680E] The Rent Controller was not, strictly speaking, concerned at all with the question 'of the ascertainment of the market value. The statutory power vested in the Rent Controller by s. 1 3 of the Act 'is that of giving or not giving or conditionally giving a direction for the eviction of the tenant when certain statutory requirements are fulfilled.
 Both sides had proceeded on the assumption that the Rent Controller had jurisdiction in the proceedings before him, to order eviction. The correctness of that assumption had not been challenged by the appellant. [681D] The judgment of the High Court must accordingly be upheld.
