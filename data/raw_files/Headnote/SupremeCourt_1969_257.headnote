 A landlord gave notice to his tenant, under s. 12 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, demanding arrears of rent due and also terminating the tenancy on the ground that the tenant was a habitual defaulter. The arrears of rent claimed in the notice were paid after the expiry of one month mentioned in the notice.
 The landlord gave a second notice calling upon the tenant to deliver vacant possession of the premises which was stated to be in his occupation as monthly tenant. In this notice another ground, viz., that the premises were required far personal use and occupation, was mentioned., The tenant, thereafter, tendered the amount of arrears then due, but the same was rejected. The landlord brought a suit for ejectment on the ground of default in payment of arrears of rent and for personal use and occupation. He amended the plaint by adding that the first notice was given to the tenant demanding arrears of rent. The Trial Judge dismissed the suit holding that by serving a second notice .,and by various acts and conduct the landlord showed a clear intention to waive and condone the ground of default in payment of arrears contained in the first notice and that the premises were not reasonably and bona fide required by the landlord for his own use. The Appellate Court held the first notice invalid on different grounds and a petition under Art. 227'before the High Court was dismissed in limine. In appeal to this Court it was contended that since the arrears claimed in the first notice were paid after the expiry of the period of one month after notice referred to in sub-s. 2 of s. 12, the court was bound to pass a decree for eviction. Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD: Under s. 113 of the Transfer of Property Act a notice given under s. 111 cI. (h) is waived with the express or implied consent of the person to whom it is given by any act on the part of the person giving it showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting. The section does not in terms appear to indicate that far bringing about a waiver under the section a new tenancy by an express or implied agreement must come into existence. All that has to be seen is whether any act has been proved on 'the part of the appellant which shows an intention to treat the lease as subsisting provided there is an express or implied consent of the person to whom the notice is given. [557 E-F; 558 A- C] In the present case the serving of the second notice and what was stated therein together with the claim as laid and amplified in the plaint showed that the landlord waived the first notice by showing an intention to treat the tenancy as subsisting and that this was with the express or implied consent of the tenant. It was not open therefore., to the landlord to say that he did not want to rely on the second notice: and should be allowed to base his claim for eviction only on the first notice containing the ground of the default in payment of arrears 'of rent.
