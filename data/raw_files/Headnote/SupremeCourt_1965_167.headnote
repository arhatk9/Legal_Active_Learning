 The appellants' predecessors by an instrument provided that out of the income of the properties a specified sum was to be set apart for certain charities and the balance of the income was to be taken by the members of tile family. The Commissioner of Religious Endowments declared that part of the income set apart for charities, as a specific endowment.

HELD :(By Full Court) A specific endowment was created by the Per Sarkar and Dayal, JJ. The proprietors had divested themselves of that part of the income to be spent on charities. By providing that their liability to pay the amount would be a charge on the properties, the emphasised that they were divesting themselves of the right to the income and the right to deal with the property as if it was unencumbered. By creating the charge they provided a security for the due performance by them of the liability they undertook. Further s. 32 of the Act provides that where a specific endowment to a temple consists merely of a charge on property, the trustees of the temple might require the person in possession of the properties charged to pay the expenses in of which the charge was created. section undoubtedly shows that the Act contemplates a charge as an endowment. [645 1646 A] It cannot be said that a charge would be an endowment only where it had first been created in favour of a person who made an endowment in respect of it, that is, to say, transferred his rights under the charge in favour of the charities. [646 B] per Ramaswami, J. In Hindu Law a dedication may be either absolute or partial. In the former case, the property is -liven out and out to an idol or to a religious or charitable institution and the donor divests himself of all beneficial interest in the property comprised in the endowment. When the dedication is partial, a charge is created on the property or there is a trust to receive and apply a portion of the income for religious por charitable purposes. in such a case, the property descends and is alienable and partible in the ordinary way, the of difference being that it passes with the charge upon it.
 The expression religious endowment" as defined in s. 6(14) and 'Specific endowment" as defined in s. 6(16) of the Act must be construed so as to include both absolute and partial dedication of the property. This view is supported by s.
 32(1) of the Act, which contemplates that "specific endowment" attached to a math or temple may consist merely of a charge on property. [649 F-650 D] 6 44
