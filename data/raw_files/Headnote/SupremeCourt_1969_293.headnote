 Respondent no. 1 as plaintiff instituted a suit in the court of Small Causes at Bombay against respondent no. 2 and its three, partners respondents 3 to 5. The appellants herein were also impleaded as defendants. According to the plaint respondents 2 to 5 were constructing a building in Greater Bombay with the purpose of letting out portions of it to tenants. Desiring to take, a portion of the building on a monthly tenancy respondent no. 1 advanced a sum of Rs.
 12,500 as a loan towards the construction of the building.
 A deed of charge as contemplated by s. 18(3) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 was executed between the parties and registered with the Sub- Registrar of Bombay. However after the building was completed respondents 2 to 5 did not let any portion to respondent no. 1 and, further, they sold the building to the appellants. The appellants having purchased the building burdened with the charge for the loan advanced by respondent no. 1 were also. according to respondent no. 1, liable to repay the said amount with 4% interest thereon.
 The Court of Small Causes decreed the suit; so did the first appellate court. The High Court rejected the appellant's petition under Art. 227 of the Constitution. Appeal in this Court was filed by special leave. The contentions of the appellants were (i) that the relationship between the parties was not one of landlord and tenant and therefore the suit was outside the jurisdiction of the court of Small Causes under s. 28 of the Act; (ii) that the charge created by the deed executed between respondent no. 1 and respondents 2 to 5 did not give rise to "any claim or question arising out of this Act or any of its provisions" but was based on contract, and !for this reason also the court of Small Causes had no Jurisdiction under 28 of the Act to entertain and deal with the proceedings.
 
HELD : (i) Having regard to the relevant aspects and the provisions of s. 18(3) and s. 28(i ) it is not necessary that there should be a relationship of landlord and tenant in respect of all the matters covered by s. 28(1) of the Act, so as to give jurisdiction to the Court of Small Causes. One type of action contemplated under that section viz., a suit or proceeding for recovery of rent or possession. of any premises to which any of the provisions of Part 11 apply may be between a landlord and a tenant; but in respect of the other matters dealt with in that sub- section, it is not necessary that the relationship of landlord and tenant should exist between the parties before the court.

 (ii) A perusal of the various clauses of the agreement in the present case clearly showed that the loan given by the first respondent to respondents 2 to 5 was for the purpose of financing the erection of the building on the land in question held by the landlords as owners and that the agree- ment was in writing and had been registered. It also included the various conditions in s. 18(3). Therefore it was clear that the arrangement by way of an advance of the construction loan and conditions imposed therein and the manner in which the deed of charge had been executed were in accordance with s, 18(3) of the Act and the arrangement was one permissible under that sub-section. [964 D-E] Having due regard to the nature of the transaction entered into between the parties viz., the deed of charge and the provisions of s. 18(3) read with s. 28 of the Act, it must be held that the subject matter of the proceedings invited by the plaintiff related to claims and questions arising out of the Act. The question regarding the nature of the transaction, whether it is saved by s. 18(3) of the Act, and the nature of the relied to be granted to the plaintiff are all claims or questions arising out of the Act and can be dealt with only by the special court constituted under s. 28 of the Act. No doubt the deed of charge furnishes, the cause of action; but its legality, validity and binding nature and other incidental matters connected therewith are all questions arising out of the Act.
 Accordingly the contention of the appellants that the 'rights of the plaintiff did not flow from the Act or any of its provisions but from the contract, could not be accepted.
