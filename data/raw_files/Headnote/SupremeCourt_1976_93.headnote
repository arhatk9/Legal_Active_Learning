 One Mr. Subbarayudu had no male issue. He had his wife, plaintiff No. 2, and two daughters, one of whom is plaintiff No. I and another defendant No. 4. The defendant No. I is the son of defendant No. 4. Mr. Subbarayudu and plaintiff No. 2 made various gifts in favour of their daughters. Shri Subbrayudu made a settlement in the year 1955 whereby he gave the properties m Schedules A and to the first plaintiff. The properties were to be enjoyed by Subbarayudu and plaintiff No. 2 during their life time and after the death of Subbarayudu plaintiff No. 1 was to get property mentioned in Schedule A and after the death of plaintiff No.
 2 she was to get property mentioned in Schedule In 1958, Subbarayudu was alleged to have executed 4 documents including a Deed of Revocation revoking the settlement of 1955. In 1958, Subbarayudu entered into a document with defendant No. 1 giving him possession of the property in which he had life interest. The document provided that defendant No. 1 should deliver 43 bags of paddy every year to Subbarayudu and take a receipt. After the death of Subbarayudu plaintiffs Nos. 1 and 2 basing their claim on the settlement of 1955 called upon the defendant No. 1 to (deliver the possession of the property. The two issues which now survive are whether defendant No. 1 is entitled to any protection under the Andhra Tenancy Act and secondly whether the deed executed by Subbarayudu in favour of first defendant is a settlement deed or a lease. The Trial Court found that the E; settlement deed of 1955 was valid and that the subsequent deed of revocation was invalid. the High Court confirmed the said findings. The same are not under challenge. The Trial Court, however, held the document to be a settlement deed and not a lease and that. therefore, the first defendant was not entitled to any protection under the Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Tenancy Act, 1956. Accordingly, the Trial Court decreed the suit of possession in favour of the plaintiffs.
 The High Court in appeal came to the conclusion that the document satisfied all the conditions of the definition of lease under section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act and could not be treated as settlement.
 The appellant-plaintiffs contended (1) That the High Court was wrong in holding the document to be a lease and not a settlement.
 (2) Subbarayudu had reserved only life interest in Schedule and Properties and after he gifted the same to the plaintiff No. 2 he could not in law imperil her right to possession of the same after his death by leasing out the same property.
 (3) In any case it was not an act of prudent management of the properties in which he had only life interest and the principles applicable to a mortgagee in possession under section 76(a) and (e) of the Transfer of Property Act would be applicable in the present case and the lease would not be binding on the plaintiffs.
 (4) Plaintiffs are not landlords within the meaning of Section 2(f) of the Act and the defendant No. 1 is not a cultivating tenant under the plain tiffs.
 984 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The document is described as Settlement Deed but that recital is not decisive of the real intent of the document. The document makes it clear that the possession was handed over to defendant No. l; that the defendant No. I was to give 43 bags of paddy every year and it further mentioned "without subjecting me to do any expense whatsoever and obtaining proper receipts from me". The document does not disclose the disposition of the property by a grandfather to a grandson but a business-like instrument. [988C-E] 
 2. Subbarayudu was old and the Settlement Deed made it clear that during his life time he would enjoy the produce of the land. and therefore` he was keen to have at least some paddy from the land during his life time as a source of income and perhaps thought that his grandson would faithfully carry out the conditions without creating any difficulties. [699C-D] 
 3. Assuming without deciding that the principles under section 76(a) & (e) of the Transfer of Property Act might be applicable, it cannot be said that granting of the lease to defendant No. 1 in the entire circumstances of the case was not a prudent act of management of the properties. In view of the relationship of the parties that was a natural arrangement for cultivation of the land. [989E-F] 4. When a person with full knowledge of the law.
 ignorance of which is no excuse, enters upon a lawful transaction or executes a valid document, the rights flowing from the law cannot be denied to those who are entitled to their benefit on the supposed theory of estoppel or a plea of contracting out by implication. [990A-B] 
 5. Section 2(f) defines a landlord to mean the owner of holding or part thereof who is entitled to evict the cultivating tenant from such holding and includes the heirs and assigns, legal representatives of such owners. Or per sons deriving rights through him. Section 2(c) defines cultivating tenant to mean a person who cultivates by his own labour or by hired labour under his supervision and control any land belonging to another under a tenancy agreement. express or implied. The High Court has found that defendant No. I was a cultivating tenant of the landlord. In view of the conclusion that the instrument is of lease there is no difficulty in holding that Subbarayudu was the landlord and on the death or Subbarayudu plaintiffs are landlords. Section 16 of the Act provides for a special forum for adjudication of disputes under the Act including eviction of cultivating tenants and under section 17 of the Act the provisions of the act over-ride anything inconsistent therewith contain ed in any pre-existing law.
 custom, usage, agreement or decree or order of a Court.
