 In 1956 the "Majumdar Award" was published and to this Award the appellant was also a party. In January/February, 1960 the workers of the appellant Colliery had gone on strike. The efforts of the management failed to persuade the workers to resume duty. On the intervention of the Regional Labour Commissioner (C), Bombay, the matter was resolved as a result of which the workers resumed their duty and also got their dues etc., from the management. in the report of what had transpired during the negotiations (Ex.D) it was stated, inter alia, that the Regional Commissioner had also been assured by the workers that they would see that "such strikes are not resorted to in future and would adopt all constitutional means to get their grievances redressed". Later, due to certain difficulties in interpreting the terms of the Majumdar Award, the Central Government, under s. 36A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, referred to Shri Palit, the Chairman of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal, Dhanbad, the necessary question seeking interpretation of certain provisions of the said Award. This reference is dated May 23, 1960.
 In the Award given by Shri Palit it was mentioned that all the parties who were impleaded in the Majumdar Award' would be bound by the later Award.
 During the pendency of the proceedings before Shri Palit, the workers of the appellant went on strike from October, 4, 1960, the cause for the strike being dismissal of 6 workmen. No notice of the strike, as required by Standing Order-no. 32, was given.
 The appellant, therefore filed an application before the Regional Labour Commissioner (Central) on October 31, 1960 for a declaration that the strike was illegal. The Regional Commissioner held the strike to be legal and an appeal to the industrial Tribunal by the appellant also failed. Thereafter, the appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court but it was dismissed. On appeal to this Court, two main points were raised by the appellant : (1) that the strike took place during the pendency of the reference before Shri Palit and therefore tinder cl. (b) of s. 23 of the Industrial Disputes Act, the strike was illegal; (2) in any case, the,, strike took place during the pendency of the settlement effected by. the Regional Commissioner, Bombay and, there fore, under cl. (c) of s. 23 of the Industrial Disputes Act, the strike Was illegal.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The legal effect of reference under s. 36A of the Industrial Disputes Act is to reopen the earlier reference terminating. in the Majumdar Award, though only for the limited purpose of the intepretation of the provisions of the award in respect of the difficulties or doubts giving rise, to the reference. Since the applicant it was a party to the Palit Award, its application to withdraw and its no--participation in the proceedings notwithstanding, s. 21(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act was attracted and the strike was illegal. [813 E] 806 Workmen of the Motor Industries Co. Ltd. v. Management of Motor Industries Co. Ltd. [1969] INSC 112; [1970] 1 S.C.R. 304 and Hochtief Gammon v.
 Industrial Tribunal, Bhubaneshwar [1964] INSC 104; [1964] 7 S.C.R. 596, referred to.
 (ii) The assurance of the workers to the Commissioner that they would not resort to such strikes in future and that they would adopt all constitutional means to get their grievances redressed, neither amounted to a contract nor was it a matter covered by the said settlement with the Regional Labour Commissioner.
 Therefore, s. 23(c) was not attracted in the facts and circumstances of the present case. In order to be hit by s.
 23(c) the strike must be in breach of contract in respect of a matter covered by a settlement which is in operation at the time of the strike. [811 G]
