 Section 68C of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, enables State Transport Under-. takings to prepare schemes excluding totally or partially, private operators from bus routes. It provides for the publication of the prepared scheme and cognate particulars in the official Gazette and in such other manner as the State Government may direct. Section 68D provides for hearing of the viewpoints of categories of entities enumerated in the section.
 The State Transport Undertaking of U.P. contemplated framing of a scheme excluding private operators from the route Agra (in U.P.) to Bharatpur (in Rajasthan). The scheme was published in the official gazette of the State of U.P., but was not published in the gazette of Rajasthan. Some private operators, other than the appellants, raised objections but the scheme was approved. The appellants challenged the scheme on the ground that the non-publication of the scheme in the Rajasthan Gazette was a contravention of the vital formality in s. 68C. The High Court dismissed the petition.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Section 68C relates to both intrastate and inter- state schemes. The wholesome intendment of ss. 68C and 68D could be fulfilled if schemes relating to inter-state routes are published in all the States concerned But, a perusal of s. 68C shows that it speaks of the State Government, the Official gazette and the State Transport Undertaking, even though, inter-state schemes also come within the compass of the provision. Therefore. the section merely requires publication in the concerned official gazette of the State whose undertaking initiates the project for nationalisation.
 The fact that for statutory construction the singular includes the plural, does Rot make it compulsory to read the plural wherever the singular is mentioned. The expression 'in the official gazette, and the publication required therein, does not undergo a change in its semantics when the route concerned is an inter-state as against an intrastate one. [40D, G-41A] (2)The High Court was right in rejecting the contention that authorities in the State of U.P. could not validly cancel permits held by bus operators of Rajasthan. [41C-D]
