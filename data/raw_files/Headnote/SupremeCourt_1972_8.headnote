 Under the Explanation to Article 37U(1) as originally enacted the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir meant the person for the time being recognised by the President of India as Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir acting on the advice of his Council of Ministers., In 1952 the Constituent Assembly of the State resolved that the Maharaja shall be replaced by an elected head of the State designated as the Sadar-iRiyasat. Consequential changes were made in Article 370(i) of the Constitution of India and in the Explanation to the Article the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir was defined to mean the person for the time being recognised as the Sadar-i-Riyasat of Jammu and Kashmir acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
 By the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir (6th Amendment Act) 1965 which received the assent of the Sadar-i-Riyasat the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir provided for the appointment of a Governor in place of Sadar-i-Riyasat. No consequential change was made in Art. 370(1) of the Constitution of India, but Article 367 was amended to the effect that references to the Sadar-i-Riyasat of Jammu and Kashmir shall be construed as reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and reference to the Government of the said State shall be construed as including references to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir acting on the advice of his Council of Ministers. The Jammu and Kashmir Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1967 (J & K Act 8 of 1967) after being passed by the Legislative Assembly received the assent of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. The petitioner was detained under the provisions of this Act by the order of the District Magistrate dated June 24, 1970. In a writ petition under article 32 of the Constitution the petitioner contended (i) that the Jammu and Kashmir Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1967 was invalid as it was not assented to by the Sadar-i-Riyasat who alone was mentioned as Head of the State in the Explanation to Article 370(1);
 (ii) that the proviso inserted by action 4(2) in sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Detention Act was bad because it sufferred from excessive delegation: (iii) that there had been violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution;
 (iv) that at any date the proviso was bad because it convicted with Section 103 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir; (v) that the 1015 detention order was bad because the detaining authority had not applied its mind; and (vi) that the order of detention was bad because it was not served or executed in accordance with law.
 
HELD : (i) (a) The essential feature of Article 370 sub- clause (1) (b) and (d) is the necessity of concurrence of the State Government or the consultation of the State Government. What the State Government is at a particular time has to be determined in the context of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. The Explanation did no more than recognise the constitutional provision as it existed on that date and the Explanation as substituted from November 17, 1952 also did not more than recognise the constitutional provision in the State. Therefore, there is no difficulty in holding that Article 370(1)(b) and Article 370(1)(d) place no limitation on the framing and amendment of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. If there is a limitation it must be found in the Constitution of the State. Section 147 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir itself provides that under that section the Indian Constitution cannot be amended. [1025 F-G] (b) The Explanation to Art. 370(1) had ceased to operate because there was no longer any Sadar-i-Riyasat of Jammu and Kashmir. If the definition contained in the Explanation cannot apply to the words 'Government of the State' the meaning given in Article 367(4) as amended will have to be given to it. If this meaning is given it is quite clear that the Governor is competent to give the concurrence, stipulated in Article 370 and perform other functions laid down by the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution. [1026 B-C] Sampat Prakash v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, [1969] 2 S.C.R. 365; referred to.
 (c)The contention that section 147 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir contemplates perpetual existence of Sadar- i-Riyasat because this section expressly bars the Assembly from amending any provision of Art. 147 and one of the provisions continued in this section is that the assent to the amendment of the Constitution must be given by the Sadari-Riyasat, cannot be accepted. The Constitution itself contains section 18 which provides that unless the context otherwise requires the General Clauses Act, Samvat 1977 shall apply for the interpretation of this Constitution as it applies for the interpretation of the Act of the State legislature. By virtue of this Act the Governor is the successor to the Sadar-i-Riyasat. He would be entitled to exercise all the powers of the Sadar-i-Riyasat. There is no doubt that he is the successor. It is quite clear from sections 26, 27 and 28 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution that the Sadar-i-Riyasat is really the name given to the Head of the State. Under the said Constitution as amended the head of the State is designated as the Gover- nor Sub-section (2) of section 26 as amended vests the executive powers of the State in him. The Governor is not elected as was the Sadar-iRiyasat, but the mode of appointment would not make him any the less a successor to the Sadar-i-Riyasat. Both are heads of the State. [1026 D- 1027 C] (d)The rule laid down in Golaknath's case was not attracted to the facts of the present case. It is not as if State Government has been made irresponsible to the legislature or its fundamental character as a responsible government is altered. Just as a change in the designation of the head of the government was earlier brought about by the introduction of the office of Sadar-i-Riyasat, so too a change had been brought about in his design ,nation, from that of Sadar i-Riy asat to the Governor. 'Mat was necessitated by reason of the Governor having been substituted 1016 in place of Sadar-i-Riyasat. There is no question of such change being one in the character of that government from a democratic to a nondemocratic system. [1027 G-1028 B] Golaknath v.

 (e)Clauses (aa) and (b) of article 367(4) as substituted by C.O. 74 of 1965 (The Constitution Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Second Amendment Order, 1965 cannot be said to be an amendment of Article 370(1) by back door. The Explanation had become otiose and references to the Sadar-i- Riyasat in other parts of the Constitution had also become otiose. There were two alternatives, first, either to leave the courts to interpret the words "Government of the State" and give it its legal meaning or secondly to give legal meaning in a definition clause. What has been done is that by adding clauses (aa) and (b) a definition is supplied which the Courts would have in any event given. [1028 D-E] Accordingly, it must held that the amending Act was validly assented to by the Governor. [1028 G] (2)The Jammu and Kashmir Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act. 1967 did not delegate any legislative powers to anybody. it confers executive powers on the detaining authority by the insertion of the proviso to section 8 to direct that the person detained may be informed that it should be against public interests to communicate to him the grounds on which the detention order had been made. When the detaining authority chooses to so direct it cannot be said that the detaining authority is exercising any legislative power. [1028 H-1029 A] (3) The detention could not be said to be in violation of Articles 21 and 22of the Constitution because they were excluded by Article 35(c) of the Constitution. [1029 B] (4) The order expressly directed that the petitioner be detained in Central Jail Srinagar and a copy of the Order was endorsed to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, as required by S. 4 of the Detention Act. Section 75(1) Cr.
 P.C. had been complied with as the order was in writing and had been signed by the detaining authority. Section 76 4Cr.
 P.C. had no application to the case because it applies only when the Court directs that security be taken. [1029 C-E] (5)The contention that the proviso to section 8 inserted by the Jammu and Kashmir Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1967 was in conflict with section 103 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution could not be accepted. It is quite clear that the Legislature has no right to directly amend section 103 nor has it the power to make the exercise by the High Court of its Jurisdiction under s. 103 illusory. But it cannot be held that the proviso is ultra vires because the proviso and the Act do not bar the High Court or this Court from looking into the validity of the detention. The High Court and this Court are free to exercise the Jurisdiction by calling upon the State in appropriate case to produce before it the grounds of detention and other material in order to satisfy itself that the detenu was being detained in accordance with law. From the file produced before the High Court by the State the grounds on which detenu has been detained were shown to have relevance to the security of the State and it could not be said that the detaining authority bad not applied its mind to the facts of the case.
