 The respondent's son was a student in the Regional Engineering College, Calicut, and was a resident of the College Hostel. The respondent received a registered letter from the Principal of the College informing him that his son Rajan was arrested and taken into police custody. This was during the time when the proclamation of emergency was in force, since June, 1975. The respondent had to make numerous efforts and entreaties in appropriate quarters to anyhow ascertain the whereabouts of his son. He saw the appellant who was then the Home Minister of Kerala. He also met the then Chief Minister of Kerala and wrote a representation to the Home Minister ,of the Government of India with copies to all members of Parliament from Kerala.
 A reminder was also sent. The respondent, however, did not receive any reply from any source. Thereafter, the respondent filed a Habeas Corpus Petition in the High Court in which the present appellant, inter alia was joined as the respondent. The High Court issued a writ of Habeas Corpus to the respondents in that petition directing them to produce Shri Rajan S/o the respondent in the Court. The court also ordered that if for any reason the respondent thought that they would not be able to produce the said Rajan they should file a Memo submitting the information about the steps taken to-trace Rajan and that they failed to locate him. In the course of the proceedings in the Habeas Corpus Petition, the appellant filed two affidavits.- In the first affidavit the appellant denied having told the respondent that his son was in police custody and he further stated that he had no knowledge that the said Rajan was in police custody at any time. In the subsequent affidavit he deposed that after Rajan was taken into police custody he was belaboured by the Police and there is every reason to believe that he met with his death while in police custody.
 The respondent filed an application under Sec. 340(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code before the High Court for taking action against the appellant and others for perjury. The High Court hearing the application came- to the conclusion that a prima facie case was made out under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code and that it was expedient in the interest of justice to lay complaint against the appellant before the appropriate Court.
 Dismissing the appeal by Special Leave held :- 
1. It is well settled that this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution would come to the aid of a party when any gross injustice is manifestly committed by a Court whose order gives rise to the cause for grievance-before the Court. If two views are possible, it would not be expedient, In the interest of justice to interfere with the order of the High Court. The order of the High Court can be quashed only if it is manifestly perverse. or so grossly erroneous or 'so palpably unjust that this Court must interfere in the interest of justice and fairply. [217 C-D, F] 
2. The High Court has taken good care not to express on the merits of certain aspects. The Court found that there was no justification to interfere with the Order of the High Court. [217 G] 210 
3. Under Section 476B of the old Criminal Procedure Code there was a right of appeal against the order of the High Court to this Court. 'Mere Is, however, a distinct departure from that position under section 341 of the new Criminal Procedure Code. It is, therefore, a new restriction in the way of the appellant when he approaches this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. [216 B-C] 
4. The Court made it clear that the reasons contained in the High Court or those mentioned by this Court should not weigh with the Criminal Court in coming to its independent conclusion whether the offence under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code has been fully established against the appellant beyong reasonable doubt [216 H, 217A]
