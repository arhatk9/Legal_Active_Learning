 J, a sardar of the Batching Department of the appellant company, brought to the notice of G, a supervisor of the department, that one R of the Spinning Department was throwing away as unusable some workable roves. G on finding the report correct, with a view to make a complaint against R's work to the superior authority asked J to collect the roves thrown away. R tried to prevent J from collecting the roves; on G intervening R took a menacing attitude and abused G in filthy language. Soon another sardar S took R's side and also abused G and threatened him with violence.
 The management of the appellant company on the complaint of served charge-sheets on the 2 workmen R and S which stated that as they had used abusive and filthy language and threatened to assault G, a supervisor, they were guilty of misconduct under standing order No. 14 (c) (i) which contemplated two types of misconduct; one wilful insubordination and the other disobedience of any lawful and reasonable order of a superior.
 The tribunal inter alia held that G not being the supervisor of the Spinning Department where R and S worked was not a direct superior of these workmen and they were not guilty of insubordination or disobedience within the Standing Order.
 484 ^ Held, that defiance of persons in authority whether such persons were the direct superiors of the workmen charged or not and also riotous conduct which made it impossible for the higher officers to discharge their duties properly, amount to insubordination.
 Held, futher, that an order of dismissal may be rightly sustained if it is based on a finding on a charge which the workmen concerned had the opportunity of meeting even though in the course of the enquiry other incidental matters had crept in.
