 In February 1956, respondents 3 to 6, as partners of respondent 2 firm, ,entered into an agreement with a Bank (Predecessor-interest of the first respondent-bank), undertaking to open in the Bank a cash credit account to the extent of Rs. 100,000 to be secured by goods to be pledged with the Bank. Clause 9 of the agreement provided that the borrowers shall be responsible for the quantity and quality of goods pledged. The appellant ,executed a letter of guarantee in favour of the Bank guaranteeing the liability of the borrowers in respect of the account upto a limit Rs.
 100,000. Under cl. 5 of the letter of guarantee, the appellant agreed that the Bank may enforce and recover upon the guarantee the full amount guaranteed notwithstanding any other security the Bank may hold. The weekly statement dated 15th March 1957 showed that the stock pledged was valued at about Rs. 99,991 but when the quantity of the goods actually in stock was verified with the weekly statement dated 18th April 1957, shortage of goods to the value of Rs. 35,690 was found. It was admitted on behalf of the Bank that. it was not known how the shortage occurred and that respondents 2 to 6 must have taken away the goods.
 Respondents 2 to 6 were granted one month's time to make up the deficit, and in spite of the time being extended, the deficit was never made up. In May 1958, after adjusting the money realised on the sale of the goods pledged and other adjustments, a sum of Rs. 40,933.58 was found due to the Bank from respondents 2 to 6. The Bank filed a suit against them and the appellant, and the suit was decreed. The decree was confirmed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended that : (1) Certain entries in the account books of the Bank showed that the maximum limit of credit was reduced to Rs. 50,000 and again raised to Rs. 100,000 without consulting the appellant, that therefore there was a variation in the terms of the contract without the surety's (appellant's) consent and, under s. 133 of the Indian Contract Act the liability of the appellant was discharged; (2) Under s. 135 of the Act, the conduct of the Bank in giving time to respondents 2 to 6 to make up the deficit in the quantity of goods absolved the appellant of all liability; and (3) under s. 141 of the Act, since a por- tion of the security was parted with or lost by the creditor without surety's consent, the liability of the appellant was discharged to the extent of the value of the security so lost.
 
HELD : (1) The entries in the books of account were mere internal instructions not legally binding on the respondents, and in view of the formal record in the original agreement and letter of guarantee, there could not leave been a variation in the terms without a proper written agreement, Therefore, there was no variance in the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor and the provisions of s. 133 of the Act were not attracted.
 [729 B-C. E] 725 (2) What really constitutes a promise to give time within the meaning of s. 135 of the Act is the extension of the period at which, the principal debtor was by the original contract obliged to pay the creditor, by substituting a new -and valid contract between them, or, whenever the taking of a new security from the principal debtor operates as giving time. Therefore, the act of the Bank in giving time to the principal debtor to make up the quantity of goods pledged is not tantamount to giving of time to the principal debtor for making payment of the money, within the meaning of the section. [730 E-F] Rouse v. Broadford Banking Co. [1894] 2 Ch. 32, referred to.
 (3) Under s. 140 of the Contract Act the surety is, on payment of the amount due by the principal debtor, entitled to be put in the same position in which the creditor stood in relation to the principal debtor. Under s. 141 of the Act the surety has a right to the securities held by the creditor at the date when he became surety. The word 'security' is not used in any technical sense and includes all rights which the creditor has against the property at the date of the contract. Therefore, if the creditor has lost or parted with the security without the consent of the surety, the latter is by the express provision contained in s. 141, discharged to the extent of the value of the security lost or parted with. [731 F; 732 D-F; 733 C-D] In the present case, the shortage of goods of the value of Rs. 35,690 was brought about by the negligence of the Bank and to that extent there must be deemed to be a loss by the Bank of the security which the Bank had at the time when the contract of surety was entered into; and there is nothing in cl. 5 of the letter of guarantee to indicate that the appellant was no, entitled to invoke the provisions of s.
 141. The words 'any other security' in the clause meant any security other than the pledge of goods mentioned in the primary agreement. Therefor.--, the principle of the section applies and the surety was discharged of his liability to the Bank to the extent of Rs. 35.690. [731 D-E;
