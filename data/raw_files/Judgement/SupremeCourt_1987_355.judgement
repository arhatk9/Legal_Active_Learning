 From the Judgement and order dated 3.3.1986 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Civil Writ Petition No. 1055 of 1986.
 S.K. Bagga and Mrs. S.K. Bagga for the Appellant.
 R.S. Suri for the Respondent.
 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana dated the 3rd March, 1986 dismissing the Writ Petition in limine under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India filed by the appellant before the High Court. The appellant states that he is the owner of certain premises in Punjab. It must, however, be mentioned that the petition is lacking in particulars as to what premises the appellant owned and in respect of which premises the appellant is making the grievances. On this ground it is not possible to decide the question of vires canvassed before the High Court and repeated before us. A petition challenging the constitutional validity of certain provisions must be in the context of certain facts and not in abstract or vacuum. The essential facts necessary to examine the validity of the Act are lacking in this appeal.
 On this ground the petition was rightly rejected and we are not inclined to interfere with the order of the High Court on this ground alone. Be that as it may as the question of vires of Section 4 of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949, hereinafter called 'the Act', was challenged before the High Court and canvassed before us. It is just as well that we did with that connection.

He urged that pegging the rent prevalent in 1938 the basic rent was inequitable and unjust in the background of the tremendous rise in prices. But it has to be borne in mind that certain increases have been provided for in section 4 from the rent prevalent in 1938. In must, however, be remembered that the Act was passed as the preamble of the said Act which states, inter alia, "to restrict the 110 increase of rent". One of the objects of the Act was to restrict the increase in rent. With that object the Act has provided certain provisions as to fixation of the fair rent.
 Section 4 of the Act which is under challenge may be conveniently set out as under:
 "Section 4 "Determination of fair rent: (1) The Controller shall on application by the tenant or landlord of a building or rented land fix the fair rent for such building or rented land after holding such enquiry as the Controller thinks fit.
 (2) In determining the fair rent under this section, the Controller shall first fix a basic rent taking into consideration:- (a) The prevailing rates of rent in the locality for the same or similar accommodation in similar circumstances during the twelve months pri
