 Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and order dated the 11th June, 1981 of the Kerala High Court in T.R.C.
 No. 117 of 1980.
 P.A. Francis and V.J. Francis for the Appellant.
 S. Balakrishnan for the Respondent.
 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATRAMIAH, J. In this appeal by special leave arising under the Kerala General Sales Tax, Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') two questions arise for consideration. They are (i) whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Appellate Tribunal was justified in law in holding that the assessee was entitled to, exemption under Rule 9 (a) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Rules, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules') from payment of sales tax on the turnover relating to 'service discount' and (ii) whether the value of goods returned by the purchasers could be- deducted under Rule 9 (b) (i) of the Rules from the total turnover of the year of assessment in which the goods were actually returned when they had been sold in the previous assessment year.
 The assessee M/s. Motor Industries Co., Ernakulam is a dealer in diesel, fuel injection parts etc. For the assessment year 1973-74 ending March 31, 1974 the assessment had been completed under the Act on the best judgment basis determining the taxable turnover at Rs. 47,42,687.71 by disallowing the claim for exemption of an amount of Rs.
 69,707.68 which the assessee had claimed as 'service discount' under Rule 9 (a) of the Rules and a further amount of Rs.982.83 under Rule 9 (b) (i) of the Rules being the 387 value of goods returned. The Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax (Assessment) who was the assessing authority disallowed the claim in respect of 'service discount' on the ground that the amount in respect of which deduction was claimed had not been allowed as a discount in accordance with the terms of sale but had been allowed as an over-riding commission and 'incentive' to promote trade. He disallowed the claim in respect of the value of goods which had been returned OD the ground that it related to the sales completed in the previous assessment year i.e. 1972-73.
 Aggrieved by the order of assessment the assessee filed an appeal before the Deputy Commissioner, Agricultural Income- Tax and Sale
